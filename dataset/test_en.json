[{"content": "We are at war. We're all in shock. It's no less the case. Nobody, especially in the Western world, has experienced such a situation. I have written here many times that we live in a global world. Now, in this global village that allows us to be rapidly connected with Australia or Canada, which allows us to do business with any point on the globe, it also returns us as this virus whose spread began in China. Yes, this is also globalisation.\nWe are facing an unprecedented crisis, because the latest epidemics have remained more geographically concentrated. The crisis in 2008, for example, was not closely or by far similar to this one. It was mainly financial and economic. We have had social consequences, but without the public health problems that we are witnessing and that we will have ahead of us.\nIt is no accident that at Christmas the most common message is the desire for health, because that good, that gift, is undoubtedly the greatest we can have. Even to deal with the financial and economic crises. We are at a stage where circumstances and risks almost lead us to say: screw the economy, screw the orthodoxy of certain decision-makers. Oh, what the hell. I don't think there is any business that is greater than the value of human life. We just can't mess with the economy. We have to take care of everyone today to then restore the economy.\nLet's be clear. Nobody can cope with a pandemic like this on their own. There are no resources. There's no way. Portugal is no exception. And Portugal already had many problems in our National Health Service (SNS) before Covid-19. We are not prepared, no more or less, to test the SNS response peak, the fans, the machines, do not multiply, much less the health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, as China and Italy have already shown us.\nHowever, not being prepared cannot mean standing idly by and waiting for danger. No, we can't. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yeah, we need to be home. Yes, we need to realize that this is no joking matter, to go to the beach or simply ignore the gravity of the contagion facility problem. In the life of society, the unconsciousness of some can, in a literal sense, endanger the lives of others, especially those of the most vulnerable.\nThat's why we need strong leadership and authority. We can't play governors. It's not enough to play statesman. We need people with fiber and a pulse to make tough, unpopular, but necessary decisions. We don't need politics. We cannot be held hostage by seemingly technical opinions, because in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the politician. Italy is a dramatic example. It's over there. To observe, learn and correct answers.\nAnd this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What's your answer? Years and years of building Europe, of bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it is every man for himself. This is what it feels like, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences up ahead. But up ahead, we all want to be alive. Living also to evaluate the answers that our political decision-makers have given us, that time will come to take stock, to make the assessments, but after the fire has turned to ashes. Living to rebuild a world that's all connected and that shows us that there's no one immune in a situation like this. Rich and poor, West and East. We are all in the same boat, humanity, just like the planet where we live, is one.\nI think there is no greater fear than death or watching our own perish. And that should be our focus. Then, with health care, with all patients treated, we must rebuild a global economy. We still can't account for the two-week damage at home, especially when we don't even know if it's only gonna be 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, catering, hospitality and other services. Yes,ma'am. I'm afraid so. The tourism sector is devastated by the cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or work well below their capacity. But we urgently need to clamp this thing down so we can get back to the terraces, the restaurants, the shopping centres and the beaches. Without a vaccine, without effective antivirus in eliminating COVID-19 we are left with, like\nEpidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola), \"medieval methods of containment: isolation, quarantine and contact mapping\".\nFuck the economy, people's safety comes first. It takes courage.\n"}, {"content": "POLL-Chinese economy clobbered by coronavirus but set to recover soon. (Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China’s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n“Nobody knows the damage China’s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n“The lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren’t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n“I think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,” said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government’s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n“We do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n“Compared to 2003’s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.”\nSince then, China’s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world’s factory before.\nChina’s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n“Every day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,” noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. “For the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus.

Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, a\nnd China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.\n"}, {"content": "Fake news alert: Coronavirus will not invade your body within 10 minutes if you do not quench your thirst.

GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent. \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm. \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment. \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey. \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged. \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola. \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET' \n Dr Thomas Frieden, who was director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest. \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm. \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said. \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine. \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets. \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\" \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. \n Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. \n Novavax Inc research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something sim\nilar for the new coronavirus. \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said. \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note. \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around US$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India Inc will shiver if China can't contain outbreak . Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly\nproduction units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.\n"}, {"content": "Suspected coronavirus case in Patna, girl returns from China with symptoms.

SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach\nto any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue a\nlong this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month’s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world’s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks’ worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can’t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can’t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe’re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that’s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain’s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there’s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\nMalaysia’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world’s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia’s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at l\neast the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.\n"}, {"content": "FOREX-Yen steadies on virus anxiety, euro hit by weak growth outlook. * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n* China virus uncertainty weighs on markets\n* Euro takes a hit before GDP data\n* Sterling sees positives in cabinet reshuffle\nBy Stanley White\nTOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen held onto gains against the dollar on Friday, as fresh doubts about the scale of the coronavirus outbreak supported demand for safe-haven currencies.\nThe Chinese yuan nursed losses as the flu-like virus, which emerged late last year in China’s central Hubei province, slammed the brakes on consumer spending and manufacturing.\nThe euro languished at multi-year lows versus the dollar and the Swiss franc as investors grow more pessimistic about the outlook in the euro zone before the release of gross domestic product data later on Friday.\nIn contrast, the pound rode a wave of optimism into Asia on Friday due to hopes that a British cabinet reshuffle will lead to more expansionary fiscal policy to support growth.\nOfficials in Hubei stunned financial markets on Thursday by announcing a sharp increase in new infections and deaths from the coronavirus, reflecting the adoption of a new method to diagnose the illness.\nUncertainty about the real extent of the epidemic is likely to discourage investors from taking on excessive risk until there is sufficient evidence that its spread has slowed.\n“There is a return of risk aversion, so yen and other safe-haven assets have risen, but reaction so far has been temporary and limited,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n“The change of reporting standards in China is a concern.

DAEGU/SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) - An So-young had a gut feeling that the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for the coronavirus might be a member of the controversial religious sect she quit four years ago.\nThe person, dubbed “Patient 31,” was the first of an explosive wave of cases that made South Korea’s outbreak the largest outside of China. What caught An’s attention was how health authorities were struggling to track the woman’s movements before she was tested.\n“That’s their culture, they have to hide their movements, and that’s why I guessed she was with Shincheonji,” An, 27, said in an interview, referring to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nPatient 31 attended services at the church’s branch in the southeastern city of Daegu this month, staying for two hours each time, before testing positive on Feb. 18.\nThe South Korean disease control chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said the church’s services, where thousands of people sit on the floor, shoulder-to-shoulder, for hours, could have contributed to the surges.\n“You would be 5 centimeters away from the person who sits next to you, and have to say ‘Amen’ after every sentence the pastor speaks - it’s the best environment for the virus to spread,” said An, who is now a theology student.\nIn a media interview, Patient 31 said she did not refuse to be tested. But health authorities said she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in Daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. While running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services.\nShincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. All of its 210,000 known followers are being tested amid unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public.\nAfter initial resistance, the church released the addresses of 1,100 facilities around the country - 82 churches and 1,018 “affiliates,” - and asked the public to avoid making “groundless criticism.” It was the “biggest victim of the virus,” it said.\nCalls by Reuters to the church’s headquarters seeking comment went unanswered.\nDuring a visit to the Daegu branch on Friday, a man who identified himself as a member said he was the only one there and told Reuters that “all of our 9,000 members are taking self-quarantine measures in compliance with the government instruction.” He said the building was disinfected twice last week.\nInteractive graphic about the spread of coronavirus inside South Korea: here\nSouth Korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the national tally to 1,595. More than 1,000 are from Daegu, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and nearly 600 are directly linked to Shincheonji’s branch there.\nKCDC said that it is still investigating the exact origin of the outbreak, but that five or six other members of the church were infected together with Patient 31.\nThe church had a presence in Wuhan, the center of the virus in China, according to the KCDC, though it is unclear whether that played a role.\nAlso known as the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the church was founded and is headed by self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee.\n“This disease case is the devil’s deed to stop the rapid growth of Shincheonji,” Lee said in a message on Friday on an internal app used by members.\nBut its secretive practices and often-aggressive recruitment tactics have made the church a controversial presence in South Korea’s religious community.\nNew members are forced to leave home and live in dormitories as part of initiation. Many break ties with their family and begin aggressively recruiting new members, An said.\nAccording to its website, followers must undergo six months of classes and complete a demanding written exam before “graduating” and joining the church.\nThe church has denied previous reports by Christian news organizations describing it as a “brainwashing cult”, calling those accusations “blatant lies” and a plot to rein in its expansion.\nAll members work as “harvesters” tasked with courting new followers from other churches, dubbed “harvest fields”, former members said.\n“It may appear Christian, but is actually completely different. They revere founder Lee Man-hee as a saviour, like Jesus,” said Lee Duck-sure, a Christian pastor who runs a counseling center in\nSeoul for former members of Shincheonji.\nSouth Koreans vented anger after an official at a Daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. He revealed he was a member of the Daegu Shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, Daegu officials said.\nBut health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims.\nKCDC is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110.\nThe county is a holy site for Shincheonji believers as the birthplace of Lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital.\nOn a recent visit, the Daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. Someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building.\nSon, who did not want to give her full name and lives in the neighborhood, said many believers, especially young women, have moved to live near the church, and several restaurants are run by members.\nDoo Song-Ja, 64, said she had not heard from her daughter since 2015, when she joined the church.\n“I’m so worried because so many Shincheonji followers are testing positive but I don’t know where she is,” said Doo, who said her 33-year-old daughter had sued her for “forcible confinement” for trying to keep her home. “I just hope she is OK.”\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: China keeps lending rate unchanged despite urgent stimulus need .

Four additional deaths raised Quebec's death toll to 22.  \n New police checkpoints were set to begin restricting non-essential traffic to eight Quebec regions on Saturday, Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault.  \n Ontario banned public events and gatherings of more than five people on Saturday.  \n Air Canada, the country's biggest airline, said it would operate a special flight returning Canadians from Algeria on Tuesday, with additional flights scheduled from Peru and Ecuador.  \n China's embassy in Ottawa tweeted that the Bank of China had on Friday donated medical supplies to Canada, including thousands of masks, goggles and gloves.  \n Trudeau has faced criticism at home for sending a shipment of protective equipment to China in February, before COVID-19 cases spiked in Canada.

Letters and parcels from China? Can be received without driving. Vaccines for pneumonia? Don't help with the new Coronavirus. Should I eat garlic? It's healthy, but there's no evidence that it's protecting it from the pathogen.\nThese questions and answers come from the World Health Organisation (WHO) website. Under a heading called myth busters, the WHO tries to fight myths. The United Nations authority is thus trying to counter the rumours about the new Coronavirus. Because rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself.\nAt the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019nCoV, closely related to the deadly Sars virus. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been infected, hundreds have died, and many countries have long reported cases. Because the pathogen was unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak are not yet predictable, there is a great need for knowledge: Google Trends is showing a rapid increase in the corona virus in January. A demand that remains undiscovered: more than 15 million tweets about the Coronavirus have been posted on Twitter in the last four weeks, and new news and assessments are appearing daily in the media. There are so many contributions that the WHO writes about an information epidemic, an abundance of information, correct but also wrong.\nIn general, it is necessary to distinguish between uncertain information, news ripped out of context or false news and conspiracy theories. For example, the story of a couple of parents who allegedly left their two sick children at the airport is circulating online. There's no proof of that. Just like a video that, in an alarmist tone, spreads alleged facts about the virus. The claims in it are partly exaggerated, partly unfounded, partly incorrect, as the Correctiv portal has researched. But there are conspiracy theories. It is said that the outbreak was based on a plot by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That's not true either.\nNow you may find this information harmless. In part, however, the false information circulating around the new Coronavirus is harmful, even life-threatening. About when they advertise supposed remedies or treatments. For example, the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Natural Medicine recommends homeopathic treatment of coronary lung disease. The effect of homeopathy beyond the placebo effect has not been demonstrated. And there's a rumor on Facebook that it cures a coronavirus infection by drinking a chemical solution called MMS. This is not only wrong, but even life-threatening when used. Facebook, usually not known for its intensive handling of false content, has now announced to remove corresponding posts from its platform. Twitter not only wants to delete misleading posts, but only to find credible information when searching for the Coronavirus, it says in a blog post.\nThe media dynamics that can be observed at the moment are not new. It resembles other news stories, whether terrorist attack or plane crash: first something bad happens, then information spreads in the social media in minutes, and finally media reports. People read posts or articles, look for more information, for certainty. But because there is still little certainty, there is room for rumors, false information and even conspiracy theories. The effect is reinforced by the fact that the level of knowledge around the centre of the news, in this case the corona virus disease, can constantly change and what seems certain today could be refuted tomorrow.\nNicole Kramer works as a professor of social psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches, among other things, on Fake News. She sees several reasons for spreading false and uncertain information: \"There is still a lot of uncertainty about the Coronavirus,\" she says, \"and because the outbreak is threatening to become a pandemic, and so everyone in Germany could eventually be in danger of getting infected, the need for information was particularly great. People sent information that they\nKramer says, often without having read the message accurately. Images with particularly frightening motives, such as pictures from overcrowded hospital halls, on which patients lie on the floor, fired this: \"Some texts will certainly be passed on because the power of the images is so strong,\" says Kr am er. We are all responsible for spreading false information. \"It is less relevant who puts a false message into the world, but who spreads it. And these are mostly people, not bots,\" says Kramer.\nBut, of course, misinformation is not only unwittingly disseminated. There are also actors who purposefully disseminate the information, Kramer says. These could be laymen who simply want attention, but also state actors who want to create unrest.\nAdditionally, especially on health issues, much reliance is placed on the experience of others, communications scientist Markus Schafer of the University of Mainz told ZDF. Together with colleagues, he has investigated how Internet users are informed about health. According to this, almost every second respondent (46 percent) claims to be informed about health issues in personal conversations with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet, in the age group from 18 to 29 there were even 46 percent (journal for online consulting and computer-mediated communication: Shepherd et al., 2019). But health issues are often very complex. \"That is why false information spreads so well in this area,\" says Schafer. Medicine is not an exact science. In medical practice, scientific knowledge and experience come together. There is sometimes more room for rumours than for scientific questions.\nThe impact of such false information is not only problematic in the short term, but also in the long term. In psychology, one speaks of the misinformation effect: if one reads incorrect information directly after an event, it can lead to one noticing it, even if one should actually know that it is not true (for example Loftus, 2005). \"This is normal in evolutionary psychology,\" says social psychologist Kramer. At first we believed what we saw and did not immediately doubt everything. The problem was that misinformation would be as well received as facts. The wrong information could hardly be overwritten. Therefore, even if people have read a correction, they may remember the wrong information.\nIt becomes even more difficult when the false information you read fits into your own worldview. Because we all tend to believe what we want to believe. In psychology, it's called confirmation bias. In the case of the Coronavirus, this is good to observe: anyone who wants to believe that the world is in the midst of a pandemic will find and share information that suits them. If you want to believe the pathogen is harmless, you'll find the opposite information. It is still unclear how deadly the virus really is, and whether the outbreak will take on a global scale.\nSo how can we ensure that what we read is actually true? \"If you see a text online, you should not just share it, but read it thoroughly,\" says social psychologist Kramer. It also helps to keep an eye on the sources. Is a contribution based on scientific knowledge? Can you check what's in there? Does anyone just quote from other media? What is the original source? Is there even one? This may sound trivial, but can effectively help identify misinformation. According to Kramer, the media, too, would be responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained false information.\nExperts already want a global media strategy for future outbreaks. \"We need effective media observers to monitor how outbreaks of disease are reported,\" writes Ilona Kickbusch, professor of global health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, in a paper for the British Medical Journal. In the future, the WHO should not only contact social media, but also work with well-known fact-tellers. This way you can also find out if information is withheld\nThe Commission's proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nRead more about the outbreak of the new Coronavirus here.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Germany is at start of coronavirus epidemic -health minister.

The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world. Asian, European and US market indices took a pounding as investors remain spooked. The US has suspended travel from Europe while India has suspended all tourist visa till April 15.\nIn the morning trade, aviation and tourism stocks plummeted sharply after as a result of the fresh restrictions on travel.\nIt is worth mentioning that the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic and added that Italy and Iran were the hotspot countries.

The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The number of people infected with coronavirus in Wuhan has reached 9720, which has exceeded the global SARS epidemic of 8096 in 2003. Official figures show that the death toll reached 213 on Friday. 2019-ncov coronavirus can cause pneumonia with symptoms including high fever, dry cough, headache and shortness of breath. The average incubation period is 3-7 days, up to 14 days. Chinese scientists have confirmed that unlike SARS, it may be infected during the incubation period.

We don't think there will be broadcasting here, but we are preparing for this,\" Simon said. The director of the health alert and emergency coordination centre was surprised by the declaration of a state of emergency in Italy. \"This is not the consensus of the EU and Spain has not put forward it at present,\" he promised.\nHe said that with the preliminary data, \"there are signs that the disease is not over transmitted. It spreads only on a community-based basis in one area, and the epidemic seems likely to begin to subside soon.\". The transmission area is only in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. \"There are fewer cases in some provinces in China than in other countries. It is inconsistent to suggest not to travel all over the country,\" he said\nSimon explained that three doctors and a nurse would accompany the Spanish evacuated from Wuhan on a flight from a Chinese city this morning. When traveling on a ship, citizens of Nordic countries can be taken to their country of origin by landing at Torrejon de adoz airport in Spain.\nAfter the World Health Organization decided to declare a global state of emergency, the Italian Council of Ministers passed a decree on Friday declaring a state of emergency for coronavirus. \"This is just to take note of the WHO decision,\" said an Italian government source. The government has allocated 5 million euros to deal with the spread of the virus. The Minister of health, Roberto Speranza, explained that these were preventive measures and that regulatory instruments for these cases had been launched in accordance with the International Declaration on states of emergency.\nItaly declared a health emergency when SARS broke out in 2002. This mechanism, used, for example, after earthquakes or floods such as Venice, allows funds to be activated and agencies such as civil defence to be mobilized to prepare personnel accommodation structures.\nItalian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte confirmed two cases of coronavirus on Thursday, and two Chinese tourists arrived in Italy in January. As a preventive measure, the Italian authorities decided to cancel air contact with China to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Also on Thursday, 6000 passengers were trapped on a cruise ship in the Roman port of Civitavecchia. A couple's symptoms were consistent with coronavirus. Finally, after confirming that the analysis result is negative, passengers can go ashore.\n\"We can identify two patients\nIn Britain, members of the same family give positive support Chris Whitty, head of the UK Medical Services Department, announced in a statement issued by the Ministry of health that he did not disclose more details about the affected people to protect their privacy.

Whitty added: \"the national health service is well prepared and used to managing infection. We have been making rapid efforts to identify anyone who has been in contact with patients to prevent further expansion.\".\nThailand is the most affected country after China, with 19 cases, confirming the first occurrence of direct human infectious diseases in the country. Angul Martinez said India also confirmed its first positive. This is an Indian student from Wuhan. She spent a week in an isolation ward in Thrissur District, southern Kerala. Russia also announced the first two confirmed cases on Friday.\nAlthough the British government chartered plane carrying its citizens and 20 evacuated Spaniards has landed at the British Air Force Base in Briz Norton, other countries continue to repatriate their nationals.\nAccording to Silvia ayuso, the military plane carrying the first batch of 180 French repatriated from Wuhan landed at eastres Air Force Base in southern France at noon on Friday. Although they tested negative for 2019-ncov coronavirus before taking off from China, one passenger developed symptoms during the flight and was immediately sent to Marseille hospital in Timon. Health minister Agnes Buzan announced that she was here to receive returnees. The others were transferred to the resort center of carry Le rouet, a resort on the coast of the China Sea 30 kilometers away from Marseille, where they will be isolated for 14 days.\nThe facility meets the requirements of the authorities to find shelter for returnees: \"first, it is a hygienic standard, with separate rooms, close to the hospital, and very comfortable and warm. The carry Le rouet resort meets all these standards\", Buzan explained. Although returnees must be checked twice a day to ensure that they have no symptoms, they can move freely in the compound, but they cannot leave the compound - several gendarmes stationed outside will ensure that no one enters or leaves the compound without permission - they must wear masks when they are in public areas. In addition, the minister said that although they may receive packages, they are not allowed to visit relatives. Over the next two weeks, more than 50 health professionals will take turns to accompany and supervise returnees, and a new contingent may join in the next few days, as announced by the European Commission, It is expected that a new aircraft will be rented to transport other French citizens who want to leave Wuhan and other foreigners who are able to leave Wuhan, mainly Europeans in principle.\nIn Paris, the Pasteur Institute announced last Friday that it had successfully isolated the coronavirus strain found in France and set up a working group to find possible solutions, including a vaccine that could be provided within 20 months.

Also known as novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, the illness had infected more than 60,000 globally as of Thursday. \n Leaders of medical teams described the difficult working conditions during the daily briefing held by the government of Hubei, the central China province in which Wuhan is located. \n “Wearing the protective suits is extremely uncomfortable,” said Dr Ma Xin, deputy dean of Huashan Hospital in Shanghai. “Sometimes I want to itch, but we absolutely cannot do that, so we just have to bear it. \n “Our doctors and nurses all have signs of irritation and even bloody marks on the bridges of their noses.

Although the deceased were all in Hubei, the province did not report one single “suspected infection” for the first time since the outbreak of the epidemic.\nThe overall toll for China now stands at 80,928 cases, of which 70,420 have been cured and “discharged from hospital,” and a total of 3,245 deaths.\nOver the weekend, the number of coronavirus cases and deaths outside China surpassed the domestic statistics.\nBeijing tells others how to tackle the crisis\nAs a result, China now feels confident about advising other countries on how to tackle the crisis.\n“China decided to lock-down Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the epicentre of the epidemic in China,” says the CCP-controlled Global Times.\nThe aim was “to prevent the transmission of the virus within the city and to other places, demonstrating China's responsibility to ensure the safety and health of the people of Wuhan, Hubei, the whole of China, and even the world.\n“Indeed,” continues the paper, “it was a tough choice for China to make on the eve of the country's most important festival,\" a reference to the Spring Festival which is normally the occasion for family reunions.\nWhile not directly criticising less stringent measures taken in some western countries, the Global Times quotes praise by World Health Organization Director General, Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, for the Chinese approach that resulted in “winning time for the rest of the world”.\nThe highest form of human rights\nThe unnamed author, an “expert on human rights studies” according to the attribution under the Global Times article, uses the way China has dealt with the coronavirus outbreak as proof that Beijing cares more about human rights than the West.\nCiting the United Nations' Declaration on the Right to Development, the author says that “saving people is the highest form of human rights”– and that is exactly what China did with its harsh, police controlled total clampdown.\n“Now that the outbreak has been almost controlled, the government has decided to gradually resume production and other economic activities,” the paper says, while the more liberal Caixin Global reports that cities in Hubei province are now relaxing traffic restrictions, and even cutting down on temperature checks.\nOverseas help\nMeanwhile, China has stepped up help to the new coronavirus hotspots, Iran, Italy and others. Iran’s Mehr News Agency reports that China sent 30 tons of medical aid to Tehran, the fourth such shipment, including 23 million face masks, 20 million three-layered masks, and three million high-quality N95 face masks.\nBeijing also sent equipment and doctors to Italy, now the hardest hit country in the epidemic. According to Ansa press agency, the Chinese delivered over 2 million face masks and some 10,000 pulmonary ventilators. “Our doctors don't need anyone to teach them their job,” Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio was quoted as saying, “but the Chinese doctors were the first to treat the virus and they can bring their experience.\"\nDespite an ongoing and increasingly bitter war of words between Beijing and Washington, and the mutual expulsion of journalists, Chinese individuals like billionaire owner of retail giant AliBaba, Jack Ma, threw the full weight of his foundation into the fight against the coronavirus – and that included shipments of test kits. “All the best to our friends in America,” he tweeted.\n"}, {"content": "Brussels guarantees efforts to overcome coronavirus outbreak \"as soon as possible\".

LAGOS/ABUJA - An Italian man who has been confirmed as Nigeria's first coronavirus case after arriving from Milan was in the country for almost two full days, travelling through Lagos and visiting another state before being isolated.  \n The case is the first in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorities fear the virus could spread quickly in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.  \n Lagos, with 20 million people, is the biggest city in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. The West African country, with a population of some 200 million people, has a shortage of doctors and hospitals are often poorly maintained.  \n The Italian man works for cement company Lafarge Africa Plc <WAPCO.LG> in the southwestern state of Ogun, the company said in a statement. It said it had identified people who had \"direct contact\" with him before carrying out \"isolation, quarantine and disinfection protocol.\"  \n The Ogun state governor, in a separate media briefing, said 28 people had been placed in quarantine by the company the man worked for, although he did not mention it by name.  \n The case has prompted a scramble by Nigerian authorities to try to \"meet and observe\" all passengers who arrived on the same flight as the man and to identify the places he visited before being hospitalised.  \n \"We have started working to identify all the contacts of the person since he entered Nigeria and even those who were with him on the aircraft,\" Health Minister Osagie Ehanire told reporters on Friday in the capital, Abuja.  \n The Italian, whose country has been hit harder hit by the virus than any other in Europe, arrived on Feb. 24 on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul, said Lagos state commissioner for health, Akin Abayomi.  \n After spending the night in a hotel near the airport, he went on Feb. 25 to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state, and stayed there until he developed a fever and body aches on the afternoon of Feb. 26, Abayomi told a news conference.  \n He was then transferred to a high containment facility in Yaba, Lagos state.  \n Ehanire said the infection was confirmed on Feb. 27 by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and that the man was now quarantined and doing well.  \n Turkish Airlines did not immediately comment on the case. There are no confirmed cases in Turkey.  \n Nigerian stocks fell 1.63% to their lowest level in two months on Friday following the announcement of the coronavirus case.  \n The spread of the new coronavirus from China has hit global financial markets, and Nigeria's economy is at risk from the tumbling price of oil, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings.  \n The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.  \n  \n LABORATORY NETWORK  \n Officials from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are heading to Lagos to help address the case, and have activated its national Emergency Operations Centre.  \n International health organisation said they were working alongside their Nigerian counterparts.  \n Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said it is in contact with NCDC and is working with the WHO and other partners to support the Nigerian government's response.  \n In a statement it said it had deployed one epidemiologist to Nigeria to support assessment and response to the outbreak, and has shipped 1,000 COVID-19 laboratory test kits to the country.  \n And the WHO, which has said it already has experts in Nigeria, has identified Nigeria as one of 13 \"high priority\" countries in Africa.

They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre. \n \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than China's, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern… not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.\" \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei's capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency's emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO's Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n \"In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" Dr Tedros said at a press conference. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\" \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, WHO emergency committee member John Mackenzie told media company Caixin. \n The global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. The experts were looking for \"third-or fourth-generation infections\", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. That evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning. \n Some argue that compared with the 2003 Sars crisis, the Chinese government has been much more transparent about the current coronavirus. \n \"Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergencies programme who accompanied Dr Tedros to Beijing. \"I believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent.\" \n According to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, China's compliance with i\nnternational health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the Americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections. \n Under the WHO-administered International Health Regulations, a global public health emergency applies to \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\". \n Since 2007, the WHO has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 2016 Zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 Kivu Ebola epidemic. \n The organisation's emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. Among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began. \n The panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions. \n Even during serious crises, the WHO is conservative in its pronouncements. Through July last year, the Kivu Ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and spread to nearby countries. The disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the WHO's fourth emergency committee meeting last July. \n Three factors weighed on the current WHO decision, according to Professor Didier Houssin, chairman of the WHO emergency committee. They were the rising number of cases in China, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers. \n While the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups. \n Under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the WHO, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination. \n After news broke of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. In addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms. \n The United States reacted especially quickly. On Jan 17, four days after Thailand reported its first case, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it would screen passengers arriving from Wuhan at major airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, the US had not reported any cases of the disease. After it did so, the country expanded screenings of Chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to China. \n Last Friday, the US declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of US citizens or permanent residents. The government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in China's Hubei province during that time span. \n As she confirmed Europe's first case of the coronavirus on Jan 24, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. She said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread. \n Even though China shared the virus' genome sequence on Jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the WHO. \n Because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including China and the US - should pool their efforts, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an international epidemiology group. \n Cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on Jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months. \n The US National Institutes of Health started re\nsearch on vaccines after receiving the virus' genetic sequencing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Jan 20. He cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require \"traditional\" public health measures. \n So long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, Dr Hatchett said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain. \n From studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the US found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, Dr Hatchett said. \n As a US government public health official in 2005, Dr Hatchet helped draft the country's epidemic response plan in the light of the outbreak of the H5N1 influenza. \n • Xu Heqian, Wu Hongyuran, Qu Yunxu, Fu Lin, Zhang Qi, Chen Lixiong and Li Xin contributed to this article. \n • This article was first published by Caixin Global.\n"}, {"content": "Global downturn looms as countries struggle to contain coronavirus outbreak.

The epidemic has killed 2,744 people in China, mostly in Hubei province. \n Dr Zhong Nanshan, the country's leading infectious disease expert, said China's swift intervention, such as locking down the epicentre Wuhan, helped prevent the outbreak from erupting in other cities. \n He had earlier predicted that the epidemic would peak in mid to late February.

KIRKLAND, Wash. - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.  \n Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother's favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.  \n \"She knew I was there,\" Briggs recalled, smiling.  \n Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. \"I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not there with you. I hope the medicine they're giving you is making you more comfortable,\" said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.  \n Somewhere between \"Stand by Me\" and \"Here, There, and Everywhere,\" Barbara Dreyfuss passed away – her hand in her son's, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \n Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n \"You find out all these things, of what they knew when,\" Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n 'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD'  \n A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. \"Today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young Briggs. \"I do not feel like celebrating.\"  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n \"Hi Doug,\" she said. \"I'm not feeling too good.\"  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n 'A TINY FOOTNOTE'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and conti\nnued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n \"I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,\" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. \"It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,\" she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n \"I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, Hillary. \"And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.\"  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n \"All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said Hillary Dreyfuss. \"It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths eclipse global toll from Sars, but 'fewer unknowns' now about the virus. LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus disease spreading around the world has killed more than 810 people, exceeding the toll from the global outbreak of Sars that started in China almost two decades ago. \n Less than two months after surfacing in late December in Wuhan, China, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000. The fast-spreading disease long ago eclipsed the 8,100 total cases of Sars, which was transmitted worldwide in eight months, disrupting travel, industry and health care, and killing 774 people before coming under control. \n Both severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, and the coronavirus are members of a larger family known to cause disease ranging from common colds to lethal infections. While both emerged from China before spreading to multiple countries, their paths have diverged in a number of significant ways. \n The rate of deaths among people infected with Sars was close to 10 per cent, said David Heymann, who oversaw the World Health Organization's (WHO) response to the outbreak, while it appears that rate in coronavirus will be below 2 per cent. An analysis of about 17,000 coronavirus patients showed that 82 per cent had mild cases, WHO officials said in a press briefing. \n \"You have to compare the two in perspective,\" Heymann said in an interview. The coronavirus outbreak \"could look more dramatic than it is.\" \n The number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus may be far higher. The health system in Wuhan has been overwhelmed by the disease, with limited ability to care for every patient or diagnose new cases. Other cases may have been too mild to be counted by Chinese officials. \n \"I'm taking them for their word, but I really can't guarantee that they're reporting the right number. The only way you can guarantee it is if you go there and you monitor them,\" said Anthony S. Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. US officials have been trying to get a team into China to better study the outbreak. \n The epidemic of Sars began in 2002 with a report of mysterious pneumonia in southern China's province of Guangdong. It shifted into a higher gear when it was amplified in hospitals and then, carried by international travellers, spread to 26 countries. \n Hospital workers were at particularly high risk, as so-called super-spreading events sickened multiple doctors and nurses. The outbreak was finally controlled by July 2003 with improved infection-control procedures and the WHO's recommendations to limit travel to areas where the outbreak was still out of control. \n While Sars infected and killed hundreds of people outside China, the newer virus, known as 2019-nCoV, has been mostly confined to the mainland, with all but two of the known fatalities there. Even as China has been lauded for its quick action and open communication regarding the outbreak, a number of unknowns continue to heighten concern about the disease. \n \"When you don't know your enemy, the fear of your enemy grows,\" said Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said on Friday at a press conference. \n Researchers still don't know exactly how the virus is spread. All signs point to droplet transmission, which means that small bits of fluid from the mouth and nose that carry the disease move from one person to the next, usually in face-to-face encounters. \n There's some evidence that people who aren't experiencing symptoms - coughing, sneezing, muscle pain - can also spread the virus. That means airport screeners, as well as patients themselves, stand little chance of finding infected people. Some researchers also think the disease might be spread through contaminated faeces, which was also the case with Sars and presents other prevention challenges. \n The severity of the coronavirus outbreak led to a lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province - with more than 58 million people - along with some other areas of China. The nation has become a virtual island as an increasing number of governments and airlines impose restrictions on travel from the mainland. \n The WHO hasn't recommended travel limits related to the coronavirus, but countries are desperately trying to keep the illness from their shores. Research on the new virus is moving quickly, and more may be known soon about how the disease spreads and how to stop it, Heymann said. \"There are alread\ny fewer and fewer unknowns,\" he said.\n"}, {"content": "BASF expects strains from the Coronavirus.\nAccording to the opinion of the world's largest chemical company BASF, the new Coronavirus will place a significant burden on the world economy.\" This year we are already experiencing a high degree of uncertainty in the world economy in the first two months,\"said BASF chief Martin Brudermuller on Friday.\nThe virus added a new factor which significantly affected growth at the beginning of the year, especially in China. Consequences of the measures against the spread of the virus were lower demand and production losses in many industries, he said, when presenting the annual figures.\nBASF expects negative effects, especially in the first and second quarters. \"I warn against giving premature revelation just because the numbers of patients in China are falling,\" said Brudermuller. He does not expect that the Coronavirus effects can be fully compensated in the course of the year.\nFor the 2020-year-round, the head of the company expects the world economy to grow at two percent slower than 2019. For global chemistry, he also expects significantly lower growth at 1.2 percent. \"This would be by far the lowest growth since the financial crisis 2008/2009,\" added Brudermuller.\n\"If I had to overwrite this, I would throw our team: Kneel down!\" said the BASF chief. \"We're just doing our strategy now, which is right. We can't change the environment, but we can make the best of it.\"\nDue to the uncertain consequences of the Coronavirus, BASF has indicated a large margin for the annual targets -\"This shows the uncertainty\". The proceeds are expected to increase 2020 to 60 billion euro to 63 billion euro -\"after 59,3 billion euro last year. For the adjusted profit before interest and taxes (Ebit) the company measures 4,2 billion euro to 4,8 billion euro after a decrease of 28 percent to 4,5 billion euro 2019.\nFor 2019, BASF wants to spend a little more money on the shareholders than expected. The dividend is to be increased by ten cents to 3.30 euros per share. The profit after taxes and minorities increased 2019 by nearly 80 percent to 8.4 billion euros in the year comparison. Here, however, there was a book profit from the decolonisation of the oil and guest daughters winters. rshall in the amount of around 5,7 billion euro.\n\"2019 was a challenging year with a strong global wind \"said Brudermuller. The trade conflicts between the USA and China had a negative effect, important sales markets developed more slowly. In addition, uncertainties related to Brexit would arise. Demand from many important customer industries had decreased significantly, especially from the automotive industry.\nIn order to make the group more profitable, the brother-miller who has been in office for almost two years at the end of 2018 put in place a savings program. These include job stripping. BASF has accelerated the savings rate, said brother-miller. Now the dismantling of 6000-jobs at the end of 2020, a year earlier than planned. In return, BASF plans to invest 23,6 billion euros in the next five years.\nLast year, BASF merged its oil and gas daughter Wintershall with its competitor Dea. The company is scheduled to go to the stock exchange in Frankfurt in the second half of the year. \"We are preparing a stock exchange,\" said BASF Finance Director Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether he comes as planned, however, depends on the market conditions.\nDue to the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the BASF majority participation of Wintershall Dea is the focus of the project. Wintershall Dea is financially involved in the pipeline that is to transport gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a thorn in the US's eye. Therefore, companies that use the pipeline The construction is currently on ice.\n\"Alternatives are being considered for the completion of Nord Stream 2,\" said Engel. After the construction stop Russia had set in motion a special ship for the laying of gas pipes. At the moment the stop has no concrete disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, said Engel. The pipeline should be completed at the end of 2020. (dpa)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus effect on world economy grows more alarming.

The funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. The Centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. A training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared.\nThe funds announced are a beginning. We would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. Earlier, states were only using National Health Mission (NHM) funds. Now, they have access to a central fund, says Dr V.K. Paul, public health expert and a member of NITI Aayog. The first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. While isolation wards are being created, Dr Paul says COVID-specific facilities also need to be looked at for Stage 3. In Geneva, they are out of ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. We need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. To support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says since a high number of people might need to be put under quarantine, local bodies have been instructed to identify hospitals, buildings, schools and auditoriums for the purpose. Even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, Vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on March 19. If there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. Since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care’, Kerala’s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation.\n2 Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and ICUs\nWith a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 ICU beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, India’s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. Ventilators will be particularly critical. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a report, said that about 5 per cent of COVID-19 patients may require intensive care, and half of those may need ventilator support.\nCOVID-19 impacts the lungs. In severe cases, the lungs fill up with fluid and it becomes hard to breathe. A ventilator ensures that the lungs do not collapse while the treatment is on, says Dr J.V. Divatia of the department of anaesthesiology, critical care and pain at Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital. He warns of trouble if the patient numbers in India match those in China or Europe. There is no guideline on how many ventilators a hospital needs. In India, we keep about 20 per cent of beds for critical care, which is about enough in normal conditions, says Dr Divatia.\nMost high-end ventilators available in India are imported and cost Rs 5-12 lakh each. Hospitals say the quality of equipment made in the country isn’t as reliable. If orders are placed in advance, more ventilators can be bought and set up within a week. With little demand for their products at home, Indian manufacturers have been exporting ventilators. Ventilators manufactured by the Delhi-based Croyox Medical Service, costing Rs 4 lakh each, have been exported to Nepal, Thailand and Europe previously. Things changed on March 19 with the government’s ban on export of ventilators. It wants 100,000 simpler’ ventilators, customised for COVID-19 patients, installed across the country by April 30. Mysuru-based Skanr\nay Technologies is being tasked to make 5,000 of these. Low-end ventilators could be an alternative if the COVID-19 symptoms are not very severe, says Dr Divatia.\nVentilator parts such as valves and sensors, though, are expected to remain in short supply. We will share the knowhow with others ready to make these customised ventilators so that the demand can be met as soon as possible, says Vishwaprasad Alva, managing director, Skanray Technologies. Experts also underscore the need to ensure adequate oxygen supplies in hospitals; many hospitals in Europe struggled to save COVID-19 patients as oxygen supplies ran out.\nAcross states, properties are being identified to transform them into dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. These could be defunct or upcoming hospitals or even hostels of educational institutions that can be converted into 250-300-bed facilities. The first such facility is a 100-bed centre set up by the Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, at the 700-bed SevenHills Hospital in Andheri. Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, has pledged his Club Mahindra Resorts to serve as care centres for COVID-19 patients. He also said the group’s manufacturing units will see if they can manufacture ventilators. Hyderabad’s Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre is setting up an exclusive 100-bed centre.\nThe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, which has about 1,300 doctors and 1,800 nurses on its rolls, has set up an isolation ward for COVID-19 cases. The institute has also freed up some 150 beds at its facilities in Jhajjar, Haryana. Regular meetings are being held to assess the situation and, on March 23, AIIMS suspended OPD (out-patient department) services as a precautionary measure.\nPlans for more isolation wards are being fine-tuned and will be reviewed by the ICMR in terms of protocol. This is among the steps being taken just in case the need arises, says Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA). We are preparing ourselves should there be a [community-level] spread. That includes ensuring that private sector facilities support the treatment of COVID-19 cases. The NHA is assessing the capacity and readiness of private hospitals on this.\n3 Stimulus for domestic pharma\nThe abrupt stoppage in the flow of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), mostly from China, is impacting the Indian pharmaceutical sector, with fears now of a potential shortage of bulk drugs and intermediates. A corpus fund to incentivise Indian pharma companies is one way to encourage domestic production of APIs. The central department of pharmaceuticals has asked the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change to waive the environmental impact assessment reports for projects by some categories of pharma firms. This, it is felt, will help reduce the time required to manufacture bulk drugs and APIs locally. The Centre has also pledged Rs 10,000 crore towards the production of critical drugs and another Rs 4,000 crore to promote manufacturing of medical equipment in the country.\nThe ICMR’s announcement on March 23 that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine could be used as a preventive drug by COVID-19 high-risk groups (health workers or household members of patients) has led to a scramble, with chemists reporting that stocks are running out. In Mumbai, most shops are out of stock. Doctors have been trying a combination of drugs, which worked for other infections, to treat COVID-19 symptoms. If this drug is proven to work, we would have a need for it, says Dr C.S. Pramesh, director, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.\nFollowing US president Donald Trump’s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine, Indian pharma companies Ipca and Zydus Cadila received bulk orders of the drug from the US. Even though India has a strong foothold in the production of hydroxychloroquine and pharma experts say production can be ramped up any time, there is already a noticeable shortage because of hoarding. While the government is planning to stockpile about 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, ensuring smooth supplies will also require a ban on its export, like the UK has done, as well as on over-the-counter sale.\n4 Reliable testing kits\nAs of 10 am, March 25, India had tested 22,928 samples for COVID-19, according to ICMR. This includes more than 500 random sample tests. The governing body for testing in India had come under fire for limiting the testing criteria in the initial days of the outbreak to those who had trave\nlled to countries affected by the virus or had come in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. While about 300,000 test kits were available, only about 9,000 samples had been tested in the first week of March. Without data, it is hard to gauge the extent of the spread or make projections on the course the disease will take. Testing can slow down the disease, says K. Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary.\nOn March 20, ICMR expanded the testing criteria to include even those who showed flu-like symptoms but had not travelled to countries reporting an outbreak of the disease. Two days later, it was announced that private labs would be granted licences for testing and orders would be placed with Indian companies to produce COVID-19 test kits. Private labs, however, say it is too early to comment on whether they can start testing since quality-compliant kits are not freely available. Also, the countrywide lockdown has crippled public transport, affecting staff strength in the labs.\nDr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Labs (one of the private facilities approved for testing), favours widespread testing. A few kits might be lost, but lives are also saved, he says. An ideal situation would be one like South Korea where mass testing is possible, where anyone with symptoms can be tested and isolated if needed. Dr Dang, however, discourages home tests. Self-assessment is not advisable as it is not reliable. The COVID-19 test has highly specific guidelines, nose and throat swabs are collected in protective packing and tested in labs with a biosafety level of 2 and above and a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) system. Trained personnel are needed for it, he says.\nThe Centre has capped the pricing of the test at Rs 4,500 and urged private labs to conduct the test free of cost, if possible. It has also mandated that only US Food and Drug Administration and European CE certified test kits be used. Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions, the first home company to get commercial approval for manufacturing the test kits, has produced indigenous kits that give results faster (in 2.5 hours as opposed to the standard 7 hours) and are cheaper (the company wants to price it around Rs 1,500). While ICMR has ordered about 200,000 kits from Germany, MyLab claims it can produce that many in a week. Its test kits, though, are yet to acquire international certifications. For me, quality is everything and I will not start testing till the time I am able to procure high-quality test kits. We cannot afford misdiagnosis at this stage, says Dr Dang.\n5. Lessons from home-quarantine\nFrom a COVID-19 positive man in Telangana, who hosted 1,000 guests at his wedding, to a London-returnee in Kolkata who repeatedly evaded testing, to the wife of a COVID-19 patient who escaped from quarantine and boarded a train to Agra, India’s fight against coronavirus is being thwarted by cases of individuals fleeing isolation. Who says COVID-19 cannot affect young people? It can. There have been severe symptoms in the youth too. Fewer, but it cannot be ruled out, says Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram. Those who are old or immunocompromised are high-risk. Recovery is also slower for them. The lungs get damaged a bit in severe cases, and this can impact long-term cardiovascular health, though we don’t know exactly how yet. Dr Trehan says that COVID-19 being a new disease, it is hard to predict who will get sick and in what manner. Those breaking quarantine because they feel they are going to get only mild symptoms and will be fine are wrong. They are putting everyone at risk.\nWhile states like Maharashtra are hand-stamping quarantined patients, to allow easy detection in case they step out in public, Kerala has adopted a home-quarantine model that relies more on community support than coercive measures. It is very difficult to convince people to stay at home for two weeks. We had been constantly contemplating how people could be dissuaded from breaking the rules of quarantine without having to punish’ them, says Dr Amar Fettle, nodal officer for public health emergencies in Kerala’s health department. The state has close to 53,000 people under home quarantine. Dr Fettle credits this to community outreach. We have 30,000 Accredited Social Health Activists and 15,000 field workers, who visit homes and educate people on the importance of isolation and social distancing, he says.\nThe state health department also makes surpri\nse calls twice daily to check in on those in quarantine. The calls make note of the medical and other supplies they may be in need of, which are then arranged for through the primary health centres or panchayats. We realised that when you let people know that you are working with them, and not merely enforcing rules, they are more willing to listen, adds Dr Fettle. There are the odd defaulters in Kerala as well, but few.\n6. Defeating fake news\nAnother challenge is to curb the fake news circulating on COVID-19 and counter it with a credible information source. Telangana is rolling out one such digital solution to fight the misinformation. We are planning a WhatsApp number, on which people can get [COVID-19-related] messages verified, a website as well as an archive of fact-checked information, says Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, Telangana government. There have also been instances of misreporting by local electronic media, such as quarantined individuals undergoing tests being reported as new COVID-19 cases, only to retract the news within a few hours without even a hint of an apology. Determined to come down hard on such misinformation, Telangana has invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which stipulates imprisonment and fine for circulating false alarms/warnings’ related to disasters.\nThe AIIMS staff has been among the victims of misinformation. On March 24, a circular from the hospital mentioned how members of its staff living on rent were being harassed or evicted by home-owners over fears that they would pass on the infection. Myths help COVID-19 spread. Doctors must be supported, not stigmatised, says Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, adding that the pandemic is a daily evolving scenario. COVID-19 is a serious threat. Hospitals are taking steps to cope with the high numbers. The public needs to play a part too. If we are responsible today, it could stop the spread.\n7. Strengthening the healthcare force\nWith an estimated 0.62 doctors per thousand people, as opposed to the WHO ideal of 1 per thousand, India’s healthcare sector looks acutely under-staffed in the fight against coronavirus. According to Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, founder of the Narayana Health chain of hospitals, round-the-clock treatment of 2,000 patients in an ICU would require an estimated 2,800 nurses, 800 resident doctors and 400 anaesthetists. At the time of community transmission in China’s Wuhan (a city of 11 million), 9,689 patients were severe and needed to be admitted to an ICU. Going by Dr Shetty’s estimate, attending to, say, 9,600 patients in Delhi (a city of 18 million) will require the services of 13,440 nurses and 3,840 doctors. Last year, it was reported that Delhi has 4,644 sanctioned (not necessarily filled) posts for doctors while the Delhi Nursing Council puts the number of registered nurses in the city at about 7,000.\nTo bridge the shortfall, Dr Shetty recommends that postgraduate students of medicine be given the option by their institutions to serve at COVID-19 ICUs and wards as part of their training. He also suggests that the Indian Nursing Council permit final-year nursing students to take care of stable’ patients while young doctors trained overseas be given temporary licences to work under senior doctors in India. The government also needs to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. Doctors should be given personal protective equipment for practice runs and COVID-19 ICU simulations should be set up to teach them the safe practices, says Dr Shetty.\n8. A protocol for safe funerals\nIn Italy, mounting fatalities prompted the authorities to call in the army for safe disposal of bodies. As with other contagious diseases, there is a strict protocol in place for cremation/ burial of COVID-19 patients to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In India, in the absence of guidelines, there have been reports of crematoriums refusing to handle bodies of COVID-19 victims. In Delhi, the family of a woman who succumbed to the disease had to run from pillar to post for hours before the city’s largest crematorium let in her body for the last rites. According to officials at Chennai’s Kalyan Hospital, the role of the hospital ends with cleaning and securing a COVID-19 victim’s body in a body bag, and the local administration needs to take over from thereon. A protocol that ensures the timely, hassle-free and respectful funeral of COVID-19 victims is urgently required.\n9. Ensuring the sick know what to do\nThe\nprotocol for treatment in Germany bans hospital walk-ins. Those who feel they have symptoms are forced to stay at home, dial a number, which can take 40-50 minutes to connect, and wait for a doctor to call back to see whether or not their condition is serious enough to be treated. This has led to severe psychological stress for patients, many of whom have gone on social media to share their stories. To avoid such a situation in India, a clear guideline needs to be designed so that individuals with COVID-19 symptoms know what to do. Examples from Italy point to the fact that the infection spread a lot more through people-to-people contact in hospitals. Italian doctors have emphasised that COVID-19 should be treated at home as much as possible.\nGoa is creating an app that guides a person on the next steps to take based on a self-assessment of symptoms. But as cases rise, this may not be enough. Some projections point to 300,000 cases soon. If that happens, India would collapse, as would any country, says Rao. She is, however, hopeful that the situation will remain manageable. We are already one of the five countries to have isolated the virus strain. We should be coming up with a standardised procedure or guidelines soon. At this point, meticulous planning will save the day. Those who are sick should be assisted with the least amount of waiting period, says Rao.\n"}, {"content": "World wary of coronavirus even as cases drop; Chinese drug trial results weeks away. BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China’s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine’s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: here\nFor related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nJapan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness.\nThe Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.\nHowever, the big jump in China’s reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients’ chest images, and is not necessarily the “tip of an iceberg” of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\nMike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.\n“We’ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,” the WHO’s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. “I think they’ve handled it professionally, and I think they’re extremely capable,” Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump’s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. “We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,” he told reporters.\nIn central China’s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary o\nf the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam’s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.\n"}, {"content": "a chinese director and 3 of his family members passed away after getting infected with covid-19. Chinese director Chang Kai has passed away at the age of 55 after contracting COVID-19, sparking anger across China after his last words were revealed. The Hubei native had alleged that his elderly father was refused treatment after falling ill and eventually passed away at home after being turned away by numerous medical institutions. His mother and older sister have also passed away after being infected with the virus. \n In his last words, Chang Kai shared that he and his father came down with a fever, started coughing and had breathing difficulties on January 25. He went to various hospitals to seek treatment, but was turned away as he was told that there were no available beds. He returned home, but succumbed to the disease two days later. \n Chang Kai’s mother, who was looking after her husband before his passing, was also infected. She was sent to the hospital on February 4 after her condition deteriorated, and passed away on the same day. \n Unfortunately, both the director and his wife, who were caring for the two elderly folk, also tested positive for COVID-19. They were said to have pleaded with numerous hospitals and clinics to treat them, but were only admitted when their respective conditions deteriorated. Chang Kai passed away in the wee hours of February 14 at the Wuhan Huangpi People’s Hospital, whereas his wife is still fighting the sickness.  \n The director’s sister, who does not live with them, also passed away on February 14 after being infected too.

We are preparing for this, \"he said.\nThis means that since January, Cuba has formulated a plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic and has taken a series of actions under the leadership of the country's major national authorities, because the disease requires cross sectoral cooperation.\nThe national director of epidemiology of minsap added that the plan was incorporating knowledge of different clinical, epidemiological features and treatments.\nIn China, because there is no land border and well controlled, the risk of entry is minimized, because people may be hatching diseases and are not found when entering the country.\nFrom the outset, measures were taken to isolate people with the characteristics of the disease in planned centres, enabling close monitoring of nearly 25000 people in primary health care and anyone from countries at risk of the epidemic.\nThey reported two new cases of covid-19, bringing the total number of infected people in Cuba to seven\nHe reported that today, Pedro curry of the laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ipk) confirmed the diagnosis of the seventh case in Cuba, where almost everyone came from the transmitting country, and two of them had very close ties with people from abroad.\nOn the issue of quarantine, he said, \"this measure is formulated in every country because its situation is becoming complex, not international\".\nHe clarified that quarantine would not be justified if established measures were taken and there was no evidence of disease transmission in a group of cases.\nSimilarly, he explained that closing work and teaching facilities can cause tension and stress, and it is well known that these processes reduce the body's immunity and increase risk.\nHe said that the country is aware of this and has taken measures to prevent reunification in recent days\nWhy did Cuba not take extreme measures?\nCommenting on why Cuba did not take extreme measures such as quarantine, he explained that quarantine was taken by each country according to its characteristics. organ\nThe World Health Organization has developed phased measures.\nThe experts reiterated that all cases found in Cuba were not transmitted, but transmitted abroad.\n\"Quarantine is based on transmission, and there is no reason at present. \"We work hard so that we don't have that moment,\" he said.\nHe pointed out that it was also unwise to close schools or workplaces before national broadcasting.\n\"When there is no obvious spread and schools are closed, there will be additional pressure and reduce immunity. He stressed that Cuba is closely following and publicly announcing that some population intensive activities have been suspended.\nCuba and acute respiratory infection\nMaria gudalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and referral center, generally mentioned acute respiratory infection (ARI). Experts claim that ARI is the cause of death of 3-5 million people around the world, Even antibiotic abuse and other minor conditions can affect this.\n\"In other words, we have encountered this disease in history. This disease is mainly viral, sometimes accompanied by the improper use of antibiotics and confusion about the similarity of symptoms such as pneumonia and bronchopneumonia,\" he warned.\nHe said that Cuba did not escape this reality. Anger is the first cause of infection death in our country, but it is also the cause of hospitalization and the abuse of many antibiotics, because most of them are viral, although bacterial infection may also lead to infection. They also lead to absenteeism and absenteeism.\nHe said that in anger, the virus dominates and causes a wide range of symptoms, from rhinitis and the common cold to symptoms affecting the lower respiratory tract, such as infant pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchiolitis. Different viruses may produce the same symptoms.\nIn this regard, he stressed that we are talking about emerging viruses such as influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, d68 enterovirus and coronavirus that shocked the world in 2009.\nSurveillance of respiratory tract infections in Cuba\nThe head of ipk research, diagnosis and Reference Center pointed out that coronavirus is a well-known virus group. It was found in the 1930s. It affects many animals, such as birds, bats, rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, leading to breathing, diarrhea and even nervous system diseases.\nIn the 1960s, a group of coronaviruses were found to affect humans and become zoonosis. There are four basic elements, all of which are monitored by Cuba.\nHe stressed that more active monitoring of the global emergency was under way, but that the national health system was monitoring viral and bacterial respiratory infections on a daily basis.\n\"Personal care can only be done by everyone,\" he said.\nDr. Guzman tirado explained that coronavirus is \"envelope virus, soft virus and RNA virus\". That's why people talk about washing their hands or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care against them because they are vulnerable to these solutions.\n\"Personal care can only be done by everyone. When someone sneezes and has difficulty breathing, if we touch any entrance door, such as mouth, eyes or nose, we may be infected with any virus. Therefore, wash your hands frequently.\n\"However, the coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan at the end of 2019 is new. As we all know, it is very similar to SARS isolated from bats. Bats are the repository of different viruses.\"\nHe recalled that in 2009, the mortality rate of mers was as high as 30% to 35%, but it was located in the eastern Mediterranean region. In 2012, the death rate of SARS in China was 9%, which was very serious.\nAs for the new coronavirus, because it is similar to the SARS virus in bats, ipk experts added that although there may be an unrecognized intermediate host, it is likely to originate from bats.\n\"Through their spy, parek\nWhen viewed under an electron microscope, it is called coronavirus.\nPhoto: capture de pantalacuba has the technology required to detect covid-19\nDr. Maria gudalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and referral center, explained that acute respiratory infection was one of the causes of death of 3-5 million people around the world, and Cuba was not spared. They can cause a series of different types of symptoms, so different viruses can produce the same symptoms.\nAccording to experts, this coronavirus is diagnosed through nasopharyngeal secretions. This is a not cheap technology with a cost of up to $50. We have this technology not only in ipk, but also in veraclara and Santiago de Cuba. \"We also have reagents, professionals, laboratories, equipment and so on,\" he said.\nWith regard to ipk, the doctor stressed that ipk has three major functions: infectious disease research, professional services and teaching. The center provides services for patients infected and suspected of covid-19 according to who agreements, China's experience and national experience.\nIn terms of teaching, the staff of the Cuban health system and other institutions, that is, staff from different departments, as well as coaches responsible for imparting knowledge in other centres, have been trained.\nIn addition, they also communicated with scientists in other places and the international health organization, not only for the prevention and control of coronavirus, but also for the prevention and control of other diseases. The expert thanks Cuba for this cooperation.\nDiagnosis of new coronavirus\nThe diagnosis of this coronavirus is carried out through nasopharyngeal secretions. In nasopharyngeal secretions, we find virus particles through advanced molecular technology (called real-time PCR), which is a technology for identifying different types of viruses.\n\"They are modern and expensive methods. A real-time PSR test could cost $40 to $50, he said.\nHe added that the technology was available in the country's ipk and three laboratories in Havana, Villa Clara and the provincial health and Epidemiology Center in Santiago, Cuba.\nImage: screenshot\nIn order to pay closer attention to the community\nPablo FeAl Canizares, director of the health promotion and disease prevention unit (prosalud), commented that Cuba is taking actions unique to the health system to protect its people. He said the plan is in line with the health experience of the country and other countries in the world.\nHe said that family doctor offices and polyclinics were being organized to provide closer care. At present, the main task is to identify vulnerable groups, such as people over the age of 60 or with respiratory diseases, people living alone and nursing homes.\nHe argued that, in addition to disinfection measures, family doctors also strengthened active investigation, gave priority to this group, and looked for respiratory symptoms for immediate action.\nHe said that the plan envisaged certification of each process and explained that after training activities were carried out nationwide, more professional training was now needed.\nSee a doctor under any circumstances\nWith regard to the communication plan, Pablo FeAl Canizares added that more public participation had been achieved. The state media provided timely and real information and emphasized the risks, but did not cause panic.\n\"The most important thing is to convey trust, security and the need to protect Cubans\".\nAt the same time, educational materials disseminated through the media have been produced, while intersectoral participation has been increased. He noted that each agency had a mandate.\nExperts suggest that any respiratory symptoms should be treated as soon as possible, avoid leaving the country, and be examined by health authorities during travel and return.\n\"Most importantly, Cubans should be careful and respect\nsabilidad y prudencia», manifestó.\nEl lavado de manos, reiteró, es la medida más efectiva para prevenir esta enfermedad. En cuanto a los nasobucos, exhortó a la solidaridad de los cubanos, teniendo en cuenta que pueden ser confeccionados en las propias casas. “La producción industrial está enfocada en garantizar las mascarillas del personal que está directamente expuesto a los contagiados o sospechosos, como los médicos».\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>

My sense is the government is not taking this threat seriously,\" Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The former Congress chief also stressed the need to take timely action.\nHowever, Rahul Gandhi deleted his tweet sometime later and retweeted again with the same message.\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya responded to Rahul Gandhi's initial tweet pointing at the map Gandhi had attached with his tweet. \"Why would you repeatedly use a map which shows a mutilated J&K,\" he tweeted.\nIn India, three cases of coronavirus have been detected so far but there has been no casualty.\nWith the threat of novel coronavirus looming large, the Union Health Ministry earlier announced that it will stock up at least 50,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits for doctors and other medical staff treating the patients.\nThe move assumed significance as there could be a spurt in the demand for PPE, which includes disposable clothing, boots, masks and gloves, in case India witnesses an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus that has claimed more than 1,000 lives in China.\nIndia is among the top 30 countries at \"high-risk\" from the spread of the deadly coronavirus, according to a study based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive in the countries from the worst-affected cities in China.\n"}, {"content": "amid covid-19 outbreak, businesses have to consider diversifying their supply chains: chan chun sing. SINGAPORE — The Covid-19 situation is forcing businesses to think even harder about diversification — from making sure that their supply of labour comes from different countries, to housing their foreign workers in different dormitories, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. \n His comments came after a two-hour dialogue with about 25 corporate leaders in Singapore on Friday (Feb 14), where they aired their concerns about the impact that the virus has had on their businesses. \n Mr Chan told reporters that the outbreak has mainly affected tourism-related sectors, the food and beverage sectors and the retail sectors but there are some sub-sectors that are still holding up pretty well. \n For other sectors, such as manufacturing, Mr Chan said the business leaders are not only concerned about the potential disruptions to the supply chain from China, but also the supply chains that come indirectly from China to the rest of the world and to Singapore. \n Business leaders also cited short term cash flow as being another concern, he said, although they added that they are taking steps to diversify their sources of supply chains and labour. \n He noted that because of the United States-China trade war last year, some companies had already begun undertaking measures to diversify their supply chains and it is likely that the Covid-19 outbreak will push more businesses to do the same. \n With regard to the supply of labour, Mr Chan said the business leaders agreed that there is a need to reassess where their manpower comes from so that they can avoid relying on a particular country for labour. \n However, Mr Chan added that the more pressing issue for local businesses is ensuring that their workers do not all stay in the same dormitories. \n “Some of the companies, especially the smaller ones, might conveniently house their workers all at the same place. \n “But that is not a very resilient business continuity plan and I think we want to help many of these smaller companies to diversify their supply chain and mitigate these risks at the local level.” \n To mitigate the problem of cash flow, Mr Chan said that business leaders can do their part by helping each other tide through the challenging times. \n “The larger contractors must not withhold payment from the smaller contractors, otherwise it will impact the entire ecosystem negatively,” he said. \n Agreeing, Mr Ernie Koh, who is the executive director of furniture manufacturer Koda and an adviser to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said companies whose “balance sheets are strong” and can pull through the current downturn should help support those who are struggling. \n “I have always believed in supporting local businesses… Everyone has to stay afloat and with the big boys helping the small ones, we can all stay afloat (through this period),” said Mr Koh, who was one of the representatives present at the closed-door meeting. \n BUSINESSES CONFIDENT OVER GOVERNMENT MEASURES  \n Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Chan said he was also happy with the feedback from the business leaders that they are confident with the measures that have been taken by the Government to combat the outbreak. \n “Many of them said they are assured that Singapore has expanded its surveillance regime to help detect more cases compared to some other countries who may not have been as rigorous in their detection and surveillance processes,” he said. \n The business leaders also told Mr Chan that they were looking forward to “position themselves for the recovery” and rebound from the ongoing crisis. \n To do so, the companies have taken advantage of the current situation to strengthen the training of their workers, review their current business models and production processes, said Mr Chan. \n “I think this speaks very well for our business community that while they manage the current situation, they also have an eye for the future to make sure that we can be the fastest one to recover (from the crisis).“ \n Mr Alexander Melchers, vice-president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said that after the Sars outbreak in 2003 was contained, the rebound for businesses was significant. \n That is why Mr Melchers, whose firm C Melchers Gmbh & Co is in the luxury goods business, has already started to make preparations for when the economy picks up again. \n “I’m telling my staff and the peop\nle that I work with to get ready for the upturn. There will be a rebound and we want to be ready for it. The staff needs to be there and they need to be skilled, ready and motivated,” he said. \n MEASURES TO SUPPORT WORKERS TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING BUDGET 2020 \n When asked on how the Government will support businesses who are struggling during this period, Mr Chan said additional measures to support businesses and workers during this downturn will be announced on Tuesday in Budget 2020. \n The Budget Speech will be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Feb 18 at 3pm. \n Mr Chan added that the authorities have taken lessons from previous national crises such as the Sars outbreak, the global financial crisis and H1N1 when designing the measures. But since each crisis still has its own unique set of challenges, he cautioned that the measures will not necessarily be the same. \n “So while we can take a lesson from the past, we must also apply them in context,” he said.\n"}, {"content": "novel coronavirus Directorate-General for Health has convened a committee of experts.

Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.  \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10 newly infected and three deaths one day. This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net “exit” of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day.   \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.  \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:  \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown.   \n But let’s be realistic. No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.  \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive. This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.  \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.  \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.  \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.  \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.  \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources — also known as the silent patients — in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.  \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.  \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.  \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.   \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed\nfrom the pool by either recoveries or deaths.  \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.  \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s. The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.  \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.  \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.    \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using “before and after” analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become “garbage in, garbage out”; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.  \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a “moderated” but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, “scientifically credible” clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.  \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.  \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent. At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.  \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.  \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London. Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence.\n"}, {"content": "In China, people are becoming more and more angry about the way the coronavirus epidemic is handled. He got the news at Wuhan fourth hospital this Wednesday. His father-in-law died and was one of more than 200 coronavirus deaths in the city. A report released by the police on Friday said he could not control himself. He pounced on the two doctors and began to beat them and tear off their protective clothing. He is now in police custody.\nThis is an event in which many people are angry, the public is angry about the crisis and the prevalence of coronavirus. They accuse the local authorities of Wuhan and Hubei Province of catastrophic management. The epidemic has infected some 10000 people. Despite the strengthened supply and the addition of thousands of doctors and health personnel, hospitals still lack sufficient protective materials and doctors and nurses are on the verge of depletion.\nThe central government is willing to end the epidemic and public discontent at all costs. The tension between the central government and local authorities is now obvious because both sides are blaming. The people at the bottom will lose. According to Nanfang weekly, 33 municipal or provincial officials have been dismissed, warned or filed because of poor crisis management.\nIn addition to the anxiety about overcrowding in health facilities, a series of scientific information has been published to confirm people's suspicion that in the first few weeks, with the increasing problem in December and most of January, key information was concealed from the public.\nOn Wednesday, a large group of official Chinese experts published a report in the New England Journal of medicine. After investigating the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, it was found that human infection has begun to occur since mid December. But the authorities insist that there is no sign of this. Finally, he acknowledged this on January 20, when the epidemic began to spread rapidly.\nWang Liming, a professor of biology at Zhejiang University, wrote on his microblog after reading the report: \"I said I was angry because I was insincere. I have nothing to say. This is the first conclusive evidence that people deliberately hide the existence of infectious diseases between humans.\" Your information has been deleted since then.\nMany Iraqi revolutionary forces are not aimed at the central government - most people agree that the situation has improved since the crisis was brought under control - but at the authorities of Hubei Province and Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang, a figure who seems to have little time in office. The most recent attack on him was Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Centers for Disease Control and prevention. In an interview with the state-owned newspaper global times, he pointed out that the Wuhan municipal government's response to the crisis may be \"mainly due to the lack of scientific knowledge of the new coronavirus\", but it also \"hesitated to take action\".\nAccording to critics, in the first few weeks, Zhou not only took a long time to provide information, but his behavior clearly helped spread the infection. In early January this year, he organized a dinner attended by 40000 people, breaking the record of the number of participants. He insisted that people take a holiday during the Lunar New Year: five million people left the city before the quarantine was closed on the 23rd.\nHe was also accused of trying to hide information. On January 1, Wuhan police announced that they had taken \"legal action\" against eight people suspected of \"spreading rumors\" - a charge that could involve seven years' imprisonment - because they reported that the strange cases of diseases they found looked like SARS. Severe acute respiratory syndrome also originated in China. It caused nearly 800 deaths worldwide in 2003. It was caused by another coronavirus of the same family.\nThis week, after the Supreme Court dismissed the charges against the eight people, the police withdrew the charges against them.\nAra was very picky about the performance of the body. \"If people believe these rumors and start wearing masks to take precautions, they will be lucky,\" he lamented\nIn a television interview on Monday, Zhou Xiaochuan admitted that the city hall did not disclose the necessary information at hand and offered to resign. However, in an unusually direct accusation, he claimed that he did not do so because he did not get the permission of his superiors to disclose. \"As a local government, we can report (infectious diseases) only when we are authorized.\"\n"}, {"content": "employers urged to impose leave of absence on staff who travelled during march holidays, can claim s$100 a day in support: mom.

MONTREAL - The U.N.'s aviation agency on Friday approved restrictions for a global program designed to help airlines offset their carbon emissions, a move that curbs industry funding for older projects whose environmental benefits have been challenged by climate activists.  \n The International Civil Aviation Organization council approved recommendations to exclude offset projects begun before 2016 while delivering emission reductions through end-2020, ICAO said in a statement, confirming a report earlier in the day by Reuters.  \n ICAO cannot impose rules but sets standards approved by its 193 member countries. Its 36-member council was tasked with weighing which programs would be eligible under the venture for airlines, known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  \n The council's decision to accept credits from six programs for CORSIA's pilot phase from 2021-2023 came despite protests from Brazil, China and India, which wanted older projects to be eligible, said two sources who discussed the private talks on condition of anonymity.  \n Developing countries had hoped a global push by airlines to offset emissions would mop up a glut of carbon credits awarded under earlier climate initiatives.  \n One of the six programs is the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the world's largest offset scheme set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to help fund emissions reductions in developing countries.  \n The fate of billions of older CDM credits, the majority of which come from China and India, was a thorny and unresolved issue for climate negotiators in Madrid in December, raising the stakes for ICAO.  \n ICAO was under pressure to strike a balance between approving enough credit options for airlines to purchase under the plan without squashing supply, which could push up prices.  \n Some environmentalists feared the council would approve weaker standards to help airlines hard-hit by the global outbreak of a coronavirus called COVID-19 that has led carriers to seek urgent government financial support.

Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced on Wednesday in Hong Kong.\nThe biggest concentration of infections outside of China was aboard the Carnival Corp-owned Diamond Princess, with more than 540 people infected out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board when the quarantine was imposed.\nThe United States has already flown back over 300 American evacuees from the ship and other countries are queuing up to collect their citizens, including an Australian flight due to arrive in Japan later on Wednesday.\n“We were lucky. We booked a room with a balcony and a lounge area, but after being confined to this cabin – I am very keen to get off this ship,” Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.\nOnly passengers who had tested negative for the virus and did not show symptoms during quarantine period would be allowed to leave the ship. Those who tested negative but were in cabins with infected people would remain on board for additional quarantine, Japanese officials said.\nJapanese officials defended the decision to quarantine the ship and test people on board.\n“Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying.\nOn top of steps already taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated late last year in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province was stepping up efforts to track down anyone with fever.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported.\nSeveral Chinese cities have declared that a shortage in blood supply for clinical use was imminent, state media reported on Tuesday, as travel curbs keep potential donors at home.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that strict measures are working to bring the virus under control, but global health officials say it is too early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totaled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies program chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\nRyan also said there were no indications the new coronavirus was infecting people in North Korea. Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths in the secretive North.\nChina’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday the economic impact of the disease would be “limited, short-term and manageable”.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020, despite some economic analysts downgrading their China forecasts.\nEven so, China’s\neconomy was struggling, with many factories closed and others still not at full production after the extended New Year break, disrupting global supply chains and firms like U.S. tech giant Apple and major automakers.\nBritain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nData this week from Japan and Singapore indicated those economies are on the brink of recession, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his country’s economy is in an emergency situation.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\nAnalysts at Nomura estimated 70% of workers who went home for holidays have yet to return to cities to work and that the business resumption rate was less than 40%.\nForeign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls, affected flight crew told Reuters. [L4N2A60YP]\nData firm OAG estimates about 80% of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week because of the epidemic.\n"}, {"content": "Beijing cancels Chinese New Year celebrations to contain coronavirus propagation.

SINGAPORE — Earlier this month, Dr Chng Woei was asked by her 24-year-old daughter if the family was not going to have dinner with the maternal grandparents until “this dies down”.   \n “This” refers to the Covid-19 crisis which has hit every continent except Antarctica, and has earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.  \n And dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (GP) replied to her daughter.  \n The 51-year-old, who works at Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. Since the clinic is a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a Covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.  \n That is why she has restricted her family’s visits to her parents’ house to less than 30 minutes each time. Even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.  \n “I can’t afford for them to catch the disease,” said Dr Chng, aware that the novel coronavirus can prove deadly for old people with weaker immune systems. \n Outside her consultation room is a staff nurse who is seven months pregnant. \n Despite being heavy with child, 38-year-old Norashinta Mansoor continues to soldier on with her duties — to screen, identify and separate the higher-risk walk-in patients at the neighbourhood clinic, so that the GPs can be properly dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE) when seeing the suspect cases. \n Asked why she had chosen to work on the frontline, even though she was given the option not to because of her pregnancy, Ms Norashinta said she had instinctively gone into a crisis mode after the virus landed on Singapore’s shores on Jan 23. She remains unfazed at having to handle her third infectious disease outbreak as a nurse — the first two were Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009.  \n In fact, she is feeling guilty that she will have to go on her four-month maternity leave from next month, and is encouraging her colleagues to take the necessary time off to rest before she goes away. \n  Despite being six to seven months pregnant, Ms Norashinta Mansoor, a clinical assistant and trained nurse with Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, pressed on to work at the frontline from the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. Photo: Wong Pei Ting \n Then, there is Ms Bernalyn Jane Tay, a senior staff nurse with Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). She had just returned from her maternity leave in the first week of February when she was tasked with managing both suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases.  \n With the frontline staff’s ongoing travel restrictions, the 31-year-old’s original plans to breastfeed her first-born — now four months old — regularly had to be shelved as she could no longer make trips to send the pumped milk back to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where her baby is, as and when she wanted to. \n She had since obtained special permission from her bosses once a month to travel, see her baby, and send two weeks’ supply of breast milk. But to make up for the rest of the month, her husband would have to make at least one trip to Singapore to get more milk from her. \n “I really miss my child, but for his safety also, I don’t want to always go back as I am currently nursing confirmed Covid-19 cases,” said Ms Tay. \n Meanwhile, Dr Leong Choon Kit, 53, who runs Mission Medical Clinic in Serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter. \n That means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. And there are no hugs and kisses too, he added. \n Sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious Covid-19 virus in Singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of Friday (March 13). \n For more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.  \n Many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, g\noggles that could fog up, an N95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.  \n They also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the Covid-19 situation rapidly evolves. \n Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between TTSH’s Emergency Department and the NCID, told TODAY that they are at “version 43” of their clinical protocol as of Thursday — just 50 days after the first Covid-19 case was announced here.  \n In recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament on Feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off Covid-19 grant will be given to 900 PHPCs, including more than 600 GP clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.  \n As Singaporeans adjust to living with Covid-19, TODAY spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.  \n  Ms Bernalyn Jane Tay, a senior staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, makes a video call with her husband Jason Raj and son Ashton Raj, just after reaching home from a midnight shift at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Photo: Bernalyn Jane Tay \n MITIGATING RISK IN THE FAMILY \n In the initial days of the outbreak, when alarming numbers of reported deaths from China dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, Dr Leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the GP community were “very stressed out”.  \n One Sunday in early February, Dr Leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the Ministry of Health (MOH), got a call from a fellow GP.  \n The caller asked Dr Leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older. \n “It is still early! Why are we talking about dying?” Dr Leong remembered saying in reply. \n Dr Philip Koh, 54, a GP with a Healthway Medical branch in Tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father “I love you”, just in case he dies from Covid-19. \n While such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information on the virus emerges, some GPs today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, remain adamant about not taking chances and risking the lives of their loved ones. \n Among them is Dr Lee, a GP who goes beyond the MOH requirements to wear the full PPE for every single patient he sees.  \n Inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.  \n But the 35-year-old, who practises in an Aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.  \n “When I go to work, the first thing I care about is my daughter and my family. Although I care about my patients, my family comes first… I don’t want to infect them. If an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) case,” said Dr Lee, whose wife is also a GP.  \n Noting that some of his GP friends are voluntarily wearing full PPE as well, he added: “If you are a family man, you just have to take care of yourself and your own family first.” \n  Dr Lee, a general practitioner, will not take a chance on dressing down when he sees patients walking through the clinic daily, even if they declare that they do not have fever or flu symptoms. Photo courtesy of Dr Lee \n DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT UPFRONT  \n The full PPE is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to “ambush” him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room. \n Typically, a clinic following PHPC guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit Covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. The process also ensures that the GP could be forewarned to don the PPE before seeing higher-risk patients.  \n Dr Lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided\nto take a tally during a shift on March 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.  \n “It beats me why they don’t declare… They lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don’t declare,” said Dr Lee. \n “I put my life on the line to help, so I am asking the public to be more socially responsible.” \n MOH this week urged members of the public to be socially responsible as well, noting that despite its advisories against doctor-hopping, 38 of 160 Covid-19 cases had visited more than one GP clinic, and eight among them visited more than three GP clinics.  \n Family doctor Jody Liu, father of three children aged four, seven, and nine, is also afraid of bringing the virus home and puts on an “almost full PPE”— goggles, an N95 mask and gloves — at work. \n But while the 38-year-old does not wear a disposable nursing gown, he has been making sure that he changes out of his work outfit before going home. And the first thing he would do back home is to head to the shower before his kids could touch him.  \n For the time being, he has also stopped wearing a watch and stopped using his phone during his two shifts — from 8.30am to 2pm and 6pm to 9pm — to reduce surface contamination. He also comes to work about 15 minutes earlier to prepare for the day and leave about 15 minutes later to clean himself and his workstation, all of which adds up to an extra one hour for his double-shift work days that he could have spent with his kids. \n These are important measures as Dr Liu, who works at a PHPC, recognises that GPs like him may be called upon to assess people under the stay-home notice or home quarantine should they develop symptoms of the virus, such as fever, cough or breathlessness.  \n “We are like the ministry’s or the NCID’s triage,” he said. “If we suspect them, then they get to the hospital.” \n MANPOWER SHORTAGES, FAMILY MEMBERS CHIPPING IN  \n Dr Clarence Yeo, from Killiney Medical Clinic in the River Valley area, had been working almost daily since February. He believes this would be “useful for the patients”, since MOH had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same GP if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one. \n The 47-year-old GP who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily — about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough — said he will wait for the number of Covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave. \n Asked when that might be, he said: “It is very hard to predict. We can’t say the next month, May, or June.”  \n Regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on. \n In his second televised address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation on March 12, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the outbreak “will continue for some time — a year, and maybe longer”. \n Dr Alvina Nam, 52, who runs Clinic@Costa located in Bayshore’s Costa Del Sol condominium, could not find a triage staff at short notice, so she enlisted the help of her 77-year-old mother and 49-year-old sister who were also eager to lend a hand. \n The two women now take turns manning a booth outside the clinic, which is on the PHPC network, to record the temperature of patients at the clinic and ask pertinent questions, such as whether they have any recent travel history over the last three weeks or if they possibly have had any contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case. \n  Dr Alvina Nam (right), a general practitioner, with her sister Ms Serena Nam (left) and mother Mrs Susan Nam, who help screen patients before they enter the clinic. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n “Am I subjecting them to possible virus infection? There is always a possibility… (but) they accept the risk,” said Dr Nam. \n She added: “My mother is also old and not in the best of health. There is a small risk and certain fear, but they are generally understanding and want to pitch in during this time.” \n Her sister, Ms Serena Nam, a teacher who left the workforce after giving birth to her son eight years ago, told TODAY: “She is my sister. It never occurred to me (to refuse to help). We are a very close-knit family.”   \n After all, she had dealt with bigger fears than contracting Covid-19.  \n Ms Nam had been a resident in Hong Kong for 20 years but she recently returned to Singapore so that her son could continue schooling as protests roiled the Chinese city. “After all that turmoil\n, you’ll kind of say, okay, I will survive,” she said. \n GPs are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. Manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.  \n LIFE IN THE NCID  \n TTSH’s Dr Ng and assistant nurse clinician Ong Zh Hua gave TODAY a glimpse of what life is like in the NCID, which sees three in four of the nation’s Covid-19 cases. \n They were originally part of TTSH’s Emergency Department team which had screened the hospital’s initial suspected cases since December, well before the NCID’s screening centre was up and running by Jan 29. They now alternate shifts between the two departments.  \n Dr Ng’s most memorable shift took place on Feb 5, the day after MOH announced Singapore’s first four cases of local transmission detected at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop at Cavan Road in Lavender. \n It happened to be his very first shift at NCID and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for Covid-19, after MOH said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China. \n Dr Ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.  \n “That was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,” said the 33-year-old.  \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the Emergency Department. Two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice. \n And not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of “it is not my problem. I am not manning this post”. “They asked if I needed help even before I asked for help,” said Dr Ng. \n Still, he remembered having only “barely survived” that shift. \n On other days, Dr Ng said he faced challenges such as being verbally abused by an unstable suspected Covid-19 patient who screamed at him and threatened to escape from the isolation area, prompting him to call for security back-up.  \n To deal with the hospital’s increased caseload, Dr Ng also had to work extra shifts, sacrificing time with his five-year-old son and wife, who is currently four months pregnant. His wife is a doctor at the National University Hospital. \n Ms Ong, 36, meanwhile, had to forgo two weeks’ leave to train nurses who were seconded to work at the screening centre.  \n She was supposed to spend Chinese New Year with her family in Sarawak, Malaysia, but ended up having to work on both the eve and the first day of the festival. \n Now that travel restrictions have been imposed on frontline workers, Ms Ng said she may have to cancel her plans to return to her hometown later this month for Qing Ming, the Chinese tomb-sweeping festival. \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse at a hospital, who declined to be named, said that her busiest day entailed her and three other nurses having to settle 20 suspected Covid-19 case admissions during her 12-hour night shift, as a result of contact tracing efforts. \n Thankfully, two nurses were redeployed from other wards so they could finish their shift in time. \n She also noted having to deal with the psychological states of her patients, on top of managing their clinical needs. In one instance, she had to manage a suspected Covid-19 female patient who was listed as a high-suicide risk while being confined. \n “Some of them were actually quite confident that they didn’t have it and still wanted to go home as soon as the swab test was out,” she said. “Some who were tested positive might still be in a state of denial.” \n  Ms Ong Zh Hua, an assistant nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, dons a full set of personal protective equipment. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n BEYOND N95-INFLICTED ‘BATTLE SCARS’  \n Now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated “shell”— the full PPE — amid muggy weather this past fortnight.  \n As Senior Staff Nurse Benjamin Ong, 29, from TTSH’s Department of Emergency Medicine, had put it candidly in an Instagram post that went viral: “Life as a frontline during this period isn’t easy, to be honest it sucks. \n “You kiss your loved ones goodbye before heading to the ‘war zone’... Trust me, it isn’t easy to breathe wearing any of those (N95 or powered air-purifying r\nespirator), and with all that protection on, you work quick and fast, catching your breath with every step you make because life matters.” \n He added: “After finishing your shift sweaty with tiredness, aching back, sore calf, painful ankles, you found out that not only is your annual leave frozen, you are not even allowed to leave the country as a frontline staff.” \n Indeed, the hospital frontline workers told TODAY it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to “degown” often for toilet breaks.  \n Besides getting “battle scars”— facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged N95 use — some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks. \n For TTSH nurse Ms Ong, wearing the N95 for more than four hours had led to pain at the point where the mask’s strap cuts into the skin above the ear.  \n Difficulty from breathing under it has also given her dizzy spells sometimes, while some of her colleagues had felt nauseous or even vomited as a result, Ms Ong said. \n Her sweat-drenched shirt from all the running around had also caused her to feel cold mid-shift, and she had adapted by making it a routine to change into another shirt during one of her breaks. \n During their mealtimes, they also have to observe social-distancing by sitting about two metres apart from one another.  \n And they would have to be reminded to eat, with nurses taking turns to make sure that team-mates do not get so overwhelmed that they skip lunch.  \n For Dr Ng, the constant use of alcohol-based hand rubs recently had caused eczema to flare up on his hands as they became dry and chapped. He had been aggressively applying steroid medication to reduce the inflammation and itch. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department, has blisters on his hands from daily use of disinfecting alcohol rub that dries out the skin. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n The full PPE had also made it difficult for co-workers at the screening centre to recognise who’s who, he said. “Nurses didn’t know where the doctors were.” \n To get round the problem, the frontline workers had implemented coloured caps for easy identification.

We tend to power through a busy shift even if our bodies tell us to sit down and have a rest,” the 34-year-old told TODAY. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s emergency department, received this photo from his son’s preschool teacher during one of his shifts. Photo courtesy of Ng Wei Xiang \n The long shifts get more bearable these days, thanks to morale boosters coming in the form of food, presents and “thank you” notes from members of the public — a marked change from before when some healthcare workers donning their uniforms found themselves being ostracised in public. \n The nurses and doctors said they are thankful for the chicken rice, nasi lemak, cookies, bubble tea, skin care products and flowers, among other things, that come their way.  \n But the gifts that take away all their fatigue are usually the extr\na special ones from their families. \n For TTSH’s Dr Ng, that pick-me-up came via a WhatsApp message during a hectic work day, sent to him from his son’s preschool teacher.

Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which lasted four months in Singapore in 2003, the current Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore is likely to continue for at least a year. \n He outlined some baseline things Singapore must get used to — such as practising good personal hygiene and social distancing — and how the country must plan for a possible spike in cases. \n Here, I would like to elaborate on some key features of the Covid-19 pandemic that may be less well-known and what they mean for how Singapore tackles the outbreak. \n First, we know that an infected person will typically transmit the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) to two to three close contacts, predominantly via droplet spread. \n What is less commonly known is the serial interval, defined as the duration between the onset of symptoms of an infected person and the symptom onset of the people he or she transmits the virus to. \n This is between four and six days for the coronavirus, longer than the serial interval of influenza (two to three days). \n Thus the spread of Sars-CoV-2 has been slower and less explosive than a pandemic influenza virus, which last emerged in 2009. \n This slightly longer serial interval provides more time for contact tracing and interventions such as the quarantining of close contacts to break the chain of transmission. \n However, Covid-19 is characteristically mild during the first few days, and is virtually indistinguishable from an ordinary upper respiratory tract infection — upwards of 20 per cent of patients may not have fever at the start, but are nonetheless infectious. \n Of greater importance is that approximately 5 per cent of confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support in an intensive care setting. \n The mortality rate was strikingly high in China’s Wuhan and Italy’s Lombardy because hospitals were overwhelmed and intensive care facilities were not available to many who required them. \n Secondly, there is no proven effective treatment for Covid-19 as yet, although more than 100 clinical trials are being launched. \n Several Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed. However, having a commercially available vaccine available in just over a year from now remains an optimistic estimate, even with expedited regulatory approval in view of the multiple safety and efficacy trials necessary. \n Thirdly, the contours of the epidemic have changed substantially since the start of the year. China is no longer the epicentre of the outbreak after weeks of extraordinary efforts including the lockdown of Wuhan and several cities in Hubei. \n Iran and Italy, however, became secondary epicentres for the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe respectively, while struggling to cope with their own outsized local outbreaks. \n Cases have now increased dramatically worldwide, particularly in Europe and also the United States. \n In several low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, the number of tests done and cases reported to date remain worryingly low. There is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the outbreak in these countries. \n This current state of affairs, where most territories are either at the ascending phase of their local outbreaks or where outbreak containment is beyond their means, is why Sars-CoV-2 will likely continue to spread around the world for the foreseeable future. \n It could even become an endemic virus like seasonal influenza or chickenpox. \n An effective vaccine will considerably ameliorate its impact in a way that is similar to measles and chickenpox, but it will not remove the threat entirely. \n In Singapore, current efforts have significantly contained the spread such that the healthcare system has not been overwhelmed despite occasional spikes of suspect and confirmed cases from different clusters. \n Nonetheless, the recent surge of cases worldwide contributed to an increase in imported cases over the past few days. Some citizens from neighbouring countries also came to Singapore with the express intent of seeking medical care. \n These developments led to the implementation of the most far-reaching travel restrictions in Singapore to date. \n But unless Singapore completely shuts its borders to the world for the duration of the pandemic, a drastic intervention that would hugely impact\nthe economy and all aspects of life here and which our political leaders have repeatedly stressed we cannot afford to do, there will be continued importation of cases. \n These have the potential to generate clusters of secondary cases, adding to the ongoing community spread already present within the country. \n This is not a cause for despair however, because we have been successful so far. But it does mean that long-term sustainability of control efforts becomes critical. \n From the perspective of the healthcare system, the key is to prevent any of its various components — primary care, acute and community hospitals, preventive services and so on — from being overwhelmed. \n This overwhelming of the system would not only result in eventual higher mortality from Covid-19, but would also have negative knock-on effects on the care of virtually all other medical conditions including, for example, heart disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer. \n Singapore’s current approach has been to minimise the risk for Sars-CoV-2 to spread in healthcare settings while creating capacity within the system. \n This includes: Heightened alert and screening at hospital and clinic entry points, delayed elective surgeries and outpatient follow-ups, as well as severely limited clinical — especially bedside — training for undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare personnel. \n But this is an immediate adaptive response to the outbreak that is unsustainable in the medium term. \n This will need to be evaluated with consistent policies at the national level to alleviate stress in healthcare staff. There is also a need to monitor the training of medical and nursing students to ensure that the current disruption of training does not affect their clinical competency when they graduate over the next couple of years. \n Different measures to offload pressure on the healthcare system and build surge capacity are no doubt being considered. \n PM Lee for instance has noted that if Singapore sees very large number of cases, we will not be able to hospitalise and islolate every case like we do now. \n The sensible thing to do then is to hospitalise only the more serious cases and isolate the majority with mild symptoms in the community setting, including at home. \n The Government has already incrementally recommended targeted social distancing practices, including the recent suspension of social activities for senior citizens aimed at protecting this particular vulnerable group. \n Other measures could include expanding Covid-19 testing in primary care (or even at home), much like what South Korea has done, and expanding the role of telemedicine in general. \n Cross-training a segment of the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps and perhaps even full-time national servicemen to be able to use personal protective equipment and function as medical orderlies could be a radical but potential way of expanding the healthcare worker pool in preparation for a possible large surge of cases in the future. \n They should ideally not be taking care of Covid-19 cases, but could help out in the care of patients with other diseases. Private hospitals can be co-opted for use for public sector non-Covid-19 patients as well. \n In conclusion, it is unlikely that the threat from Sars-CoV-2 will end in 2020, and may not entirely be dispelled even if an effective vaccine became available next year. \n Singapore has been successful in containing the epidemic to date, but will need to adapt further and implement innovative interventions in the healthcare system to ensure the sustainability of these efforts. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.\n"}, {"content": "Stella karoni: coronavirus puts the world between the dignity and pain of a dying system.

Surprisingly, they did not cancel these exercises, which involved the transportation of soldiers to the European front under such circumstances.\nIn addition, there is a media campaign as terrible as the days after the twin towers bombing (2001), There are still serious doubts about those responsible for this incident and the implosion effect of rapidly destroying the powerful steel structure foundation.\nFrom the point of view of the use of biological warfare, the United States has repeatedly called - not to forget dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and other diseases against Cuba - and supported its Israeli partners, This may be a perfect article on how the Chinese giant obsessed with imperial power will react and how the world will respond to this situation, which is characterized by \"uncontrollable\" viruses, but less lethal than the common influenza and pneumonia epidemics.\nSoon, powerful people accused the epidemic of causing their economic ills, but \"the economy is sick. Eric Toussaint, a political scientist and professor at the University of Liege and the University of Paris, said that the coronavirus has further proved that it will only continue to use stimulants. He is the head of the Committee for the abolition of illegal debt (cadtm).\nTucson carefully analyzed all the declines in the stock markets of these major countries, especially since the last week of February 2020, which was the worst week since the crisis in October 2008. \"At least from 2017 to 2018, all factors of the new round of financial crisis have existed and existed together for several years. When the atmosphere is filled with flammable substances at any time, sparks will trigger a financial explosion. It is difficult to predict where sparks will occur. Spark seems to be a trigger, but it is not the root of the crisis. We still do not know whether the sharp decline in the stock market at the end of February 2020 will \"degenerate\" into a huge financial crisis. But this is a real possibility, \"Tucson said.\nHe also warned that \"it is important to see the real source of the crisis and not be deceived by the explanation that the real cause constitutes a smoke screen\".\nAt the same time, what we see in Europe is nothing more than exposing the destruction of the welfare system. In these countries, the level of the welfare system has been successfully established. There is a certainty - which has never existed in our region - that is always obtained.\nNo one commented on the huge misappropriation of spending in the colonial wars of this century to every European country. From the beginning, the United States and its partners in the North Atlantic Organization (NATO) made it clear: \"we have the necessary weapons, but you must pay for it.\"\nHow much did Europe sacrifice to take over a war, invade and occupy some countries, negotiate with these countries and obtain oil and other products paid in euros\nOthers and peace.\nThe wars of colonial occupation against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen (all ongoing) and other countries under preparation not only destroyed countries where millions of people died and caused humanitarian disasters, but also destroyed sites, human heritage cities and the cradle of civilization, Violations of all the rights of the injured state and international law protected by shameful impunity.\nThese unilateral colonial wars have brought tragedy to the European people, who are the victims of Neo liberalism. In order to pay for sophisticated weapons and the latest technology and equipment, European governments may have used nearly 290 billion euros. These funds were stolen from the Libyan government as jackals because they were placed in European banks to raise funds under the U.S. blockade.\nIn these highly criminal colonial wars, the biggest \"beneficiaries\" were the arms and equipment manufacturers of the United States and Israel.\nEven American economists have warned that the strategies of these wars, drawn on the big map of the Pentagon hall, are also destined to destroy the competitive capitalist group, the European Union. This also means a \"war against the euro\", which is defended by Angela Merkel, Germany's most political capitalist ruler, with a cloak and a sword.\nAt the end of the humanitarian disaster caused by invasion and occupation, these wars brought millions of desperate, hungry, homeless and stateless immigrants to Europe. As long as we look at the figures of international organizations before these barbaric invasions, we can understand that the living standards of people in Libya or Syria are sometimes higher than those of ordinary European citizens.\nThousands of desperate people fled the war and were abandoned by international organizations. They were either swallowed by the sea or destined to live on the edge of terror like abused beggars. What did Europe win all this? Who led the occupation of these countries? Who embezzled oil and other territorial wealth?

How many people are infected? What's the name of the hospital? It could be the U.S. Army. On March 9, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian wrote on Twitter: \"this has led to the epidemic in Wuhan.\".\nMeanwhile, Philip giraldi, a former CIA agent, told hispan TV that his country may have created the virus as a weapon of war to harm China and Iran. As for Italy, some analysts pointed out that it was the first European country to sign so many important agreements with China, which angered Washington.\nThe Iranian military also condemned that several studies show that covid-19 may be a new strategy and form of war against the enemy by the United States and its allies to \"cause death, instability and instability\".\nInternational analyst Jos é jofr é leal warned that this is not a \"new strategy and new form of war\", because according to research and research, the epidemic combines \"elements of conventional war, unconventional war, biological war and cyber war\".\nHe also referred to the statement of Ayatollah said Ali Khamenei, leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, who ordered mobilization to deal with biological war, provided that the outbreak of kovid-19 was such an attack. It is believed that the United States will use the new coronavirus as a biological weapon. Referring to their exercise in Wuhan, the expert said that the most important thing is that the Chinese themselves have acknowledged that the U.S. Army may bring coronavirus into China.\nRobert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), publicly admitted on March 11 last year that some Americans apparently died\nAt the final diagnosis, the new coronavirus test was positive.\nSimilarly, Maria zarajova, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, believed that the United States' coronavirus charges against Russia were \"deliberately fabricated\". She recalled that Wilbur Ross, Russian Minister of Commerce, Last February, he told China's global times that he thought the virus was \"an opportunity\" because it could help the United States restore employment in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.\nIn this context, who warns that the time to eradicate coronavirus is shortening and that coronavirus has become an epidemic not so much because the mortality rate is lower than that of seasonal influenza and pneumonia as because of the number of affected countries, In particular, he expressed concern about the cases in Italy where there was no \"clear epidemiological link\" with the events in China.\nUnder such multiple circumstances, the media of the system covered up the truth. In the face of humanitarian tragedy, they did not hesitate to manipulate information and use it as a weapon of blind war.\nIn so many shadows, although Cuba, from a small island in the Caribbean, is blocked by the world's largest power (the United States), it cooperates with the Cuban government to produce drugs in a large Chinese laboratory, making it possible for China to control the disease.\nAnd the far right and coup governments in Latin America deprived their populations of the only drugs they sacrificed in their lives from Cuban doctors, such as in Brazil, Bolivia and elsewhere, condemning people's neglect of health, Italy requested medical assistance from the Cuban government.\nThese are the light and shadow of an extremely fragile moment in the world.

The Great Helmsman swam the 16th of July 1966 in the waters of the Wuham River, accompanied by bodyguards, to show that at the age of 73 years he was in full physical form. It is considered the largest act of political propaganda in the People's Republic of China.\nThe images of the country's founding father, the historic leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the founder of Maoism, ran worldwide. Mao Tse-Tung had his summer residence in Wuham, the capital of Hunan province where he was born, in the poor village of Shaoshan, four hundred kilometres away, where even today the leader is idolized.\nThe occasion is celebrated every year, thousands of Mao worshipers enter Yangt se, but the city that bathes is no longer the same, has become the mecca of capitalism to China, torn by skyscrapers, populated by western chain stores of clothing, fast food, attended by thousands of students at one of the largest Chinese universities and cradle of production units of the major brands of the car industry, which earned her the comparison with Detroit before the decline of the American city.\nThousands of migrants live there working in the large units of General Motors, Honda, Nissan, PSA and Renault, as well as in Chinese Dongfeng (PSA partner and shareholder) and SAIC (GM partner) which employs six thousand people.\nBut it was in the traditional unhealthy market ruckus that was to be closed last year and that sells fish, shellfish and poultry, but also exotic animals for human consumption from hedgehogs to live crocodiles that were identified among space vendors and visitors with symptoms of pneumonia, then reported to the World Health Organisation on the last day of last year.\nA week later, already in 2020, a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified, which quarantined the city and spread the alarm throughout Mao's cradle province, infecting the rest of the world, first with the cutting of several international air links to prevent the virus from travelling. Still, a few days after the alarm there were more than six thousand cases in all of central China, hundreds and a half of deaths, and the record of cases in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other Asian countries, but also in Australia, the United States, South America and Europe.\n15 million people were expected to pass through Wuham during the minivacation period of the Chinese New Year- perhaps many could have gone a few miles north to the Panlongcheng archaeological site, which dates from the Shang dynasty, between 1600 and 1046 a.C. The expenses of entertainment and transportation, according to S&P Global, They should drop ten percent because of the Coronavirus.\nHistorical city\nWuhan has more inhabitants than Portugal. Nearly 11 million people live there, despite everything that is not expressive to Chinese standards: it is only the seventh most populous city in China when classified by urban population.\nBut Wuhan is of vital importance in the economic health of the country, located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River, with a hundred kilometres extension, is an important communication and distribution centre for the whole of central China and also for the main economic partners. There follow the inland, air and rail transport networks that are involved in the growth of the second largest economy in the world.\nThe economic, political and commercial centre of the region is often called the \"Chinese Way\" and economists predict that the impact on the Chinese Gross Domestic Product of the partial quarantine imposed by the Coronavirus is at least one per cent. If the emergency does not go far beyond the commemorations of the Chinese New Year, last January's 25th, whose traditional holiday was celebrated this year in protective masks on the face or at home, as the authorities have imposed.\nIn 2019, the growth of Wuhan's GDP was 7,8 per cent, 1,7 percentage points above the national average. The total import and export value reached 244 billion yuans (about 40 billion euro), a record that was 13,7 per cent above the previous year and represented 61,9 percent of the total value of foreign trade in the province.\nMore than 300 of the 500 largest companies in the world are present in the city, including Microsoft.

Fifteen years later, the troops led by Chiang Kai-shek conquered the city, giving breath to control of the territory by the alliance between their Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party, which already comprised the entire southeast of the country.\nBut Wuhan was also a symbol of the division between the KMT and the Communists. The war with Japan, which invaded China as part of its expansionist plans even before World War II, put an end to Chiang Kai-shek's attempts to unify the country. Before the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to abandon the capital, Nanjing, retreating to Wuhan and then to the remote town of Chongqing.\nIn July of 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, there was a so-called Wuhan incident: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for control of the city. The two opposing forces were the \"Million Heroes\" and the \"General Headquarters of the Wuhan Workers\".\nThe first included 500 thousand people, mainly skilled workers, civil servants and the party, and was supported by the commander of Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The General Headquarters, with many other supporters, was composed of workers and students from the Red Guard. They engaged in a propaganda war to gain support from the local community -Mao was president of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and had already swam in the waters of Yangth.\nTwelve days later, the 28 of July 1966, representatives of the Red Guard wrote to Mao, claiming rebellion and rebellion to carry out the Cultural Revolution. Many people accused of being counter-revolutionary were forced to commit suicide.\nDuring 1966's'red August', 1772 were killed only in Beijing. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders. The Wuhan incident was considered crucial in the evolution of the so-called Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus scare: Flyers from China to be screened at 7 airports. \nThe Civil Aviation Ministry has directed seven airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata to make arrangements for screening of passengers arriving from China in the wake of outbreak of an infection caused by a new strain of virus there.\nAirlines flying in from any airport in China including Hong Kong have been asked to make in-flight announcements requesting passengers with history of fever and cough and travel to Wuhan city in the past 14 days to self-declare at the port of arrival in order to facilitate early isolation, according to an official statement on Tuesday.\nThis is in continuation to the travel advisory issued by the Union Health Ministry regarding threat of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei province of China asking citizens to follow certain precautionary measures while visiting the country.\nAs part of an action plan by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), airlines staff will also guide the passengers in filling up the self-reporting forms, before disembarking, to be checked by staff on arrival.\n'The MoCA has directed for all logistics support and arrangements to be made immediately with regard to screening of passengers arriving in India from China including Hong Kong at the identified airports -- Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin apart from three airports at Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata identified earlier,' the statement said.\nThe action-plan includes thermal screening of passengers to be undertaken, it said.\nThermal cameras will be installed at the pre-immigration area of the seven identified airports and airlines staff will bring the passengers to the health counters before the immigration check.\nThe coronavirus (CoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed four people in China is a novel strain not seen before.\nCommon symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) strain, which has infected more than 300 people since the outbreak in Wuhan in December, include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.\nIn more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.\nAirports have also been asked to display signages at strategic locations of the seven identified airports for screening.\nAlso, if an ill passenger or crew member is confirmed as a probable case of nCoV, public health authorities should be notified about the contacts using the passenger locator form, the statement said.\nThe MoCA has called for immediate implementation of the action plan and strict adherence by identified airports and all airlines concerned.\nAccording to the alert issued by the MoCA, all travellers who have visited China, particularly through Wuhan during the past 14 days and show symptoms of acute onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath should report to the airport health unit.\n\"For other travellers (those without any symptoms), who have visited the affected city and do not have any symptoms on arrival, but develop above mentioned symptoms within 28 days of arrival in India, should visit nearest hospital facility and report to the state/district health authorities and concerned airport health officer,\" the alert read.\nMeanwhile, the health ministry has sought from the Ministry of External Affairs details of those who have applied for Indian visa since December 31 so that they can be counselled.\nThe MEA has also been requested to disseminate travel advisory to Indian embassies in China and adjoining countries in local languages for wider circulation and passenger information, the health ministry said in a statement.\nThe Union health secretary has also written to states and Union Territories to review their preparedness, identify gaps and strengthen core capacities in the area of surveillance, laboratory support and in particular, hospital preparedness in terms of isolation and ventilator management of patients with severe respiratory illness.\n"}, {"content": "covid-19: hopes for vaccine rise after chinese scientists find infected monkeys developed immunity. HONG KONG — Scientists who infected monkeys with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 have found that those that recovered developed effective immunity from the disease — a potentially important discovery in the race to develop a vaccine. \n But the researchers also found that the animals could become infected through their eyes, which means wearing a face mask may not be enough to protect people from the disease. \n Scientists around the world have been racing to develop a vaccine and the first clinical trials could be held in China and the US within a month. \n But a number of cases, where people who had tested negative for the disease and were discharged from hospital only to give a positive result a few days later, have cast doubt on the process. \n The rate of reoccurrence ranged from 0.1 to 1 per cent nationwide, according to China’s state media reports. However, in some provinces such as Guangdong up to 14 per cent of the discharged patients had reportedly returned to hospital because of the test results. \n If it turns out that these patients had been reinfected by the same virus, then vaccines will not prove effective. \n But the monkey experiment carried out by a team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences may help dispel that fear. \n Details of the experiment were made available last Saturday (March 14) on bioRxiv, a website for studies pending peer review. \n Professor Qin Chuan wrote that his research team infected four rhesus monkeys with the Covid-19 strain and the animals started to show signs of sickness three days later. \n They developed a fever, started struggling to breath and lost their appetite and weight. \n On the seventh day of the experiment, Prof Qin euthanised one of the monkeys and found the virus had spread throughout its body from nose to bladder with visible damage to the lung tissues. \n The remaining monkeys, however, recovered gradually and eventually stopped showing symptoms. \n About a month later, after tests returned negative results and X-rays showed their internal organs had fully recovered, two monkeys were dosed with the virus through the mouth. \n The scientists recorded a temporary temperature rise, but other than that everything appeared to stay normal. \n Autopsies were performed on these two monkeys about two weeks later, and the researchers could not find a trace of the virus in their body. \n Meanwhile, very high antibody levels were detected after the second week, suggesting that the immune system was prepared to fight the disease. \n Prof Qin said the results would have “important implications in evaluating vaccine development”. \n The researchers argued that the positive test on some recovered patients may be down to some other cause rather than the patients becoming reinfected. \n “It may be attributed to ‘false negative’… test results before their discharge or the patients not making a full recovery even though they meet the criteria for a discharge,” they wrote. \n The animal experiment supports observations made by some doctors on the front line in the fight against the disease. \n Professor Zhong Nanshan, a leading government scientist, said in Guangzhou last week that they had found a strong presence of antibodies in recovered patients, which meant the virus could no longer use them as a carrier again. \n “Now the question everyone cares about is whether the close contacts and family members may be infected because (the patient) tested positive again. So far I have not seen any evidence,” Zhong said. \n Nonetheless, the government has taken precautions. From March 5, all patients discharged from hospitals need to stay in a quarantine facility for another two weeks. \n A doctor, who works at a public hospital in Beijing looking after Covid-19 patients, said the experiment provided valuable information because monkeys are genetically close to humans but “what happens on monkeys does not always work on us”. \n The doctor also said that a recent case in Japan has caused “some concerns in medical circles” after the health authorities reported that a 70-year-old patient who had recovered was hospitalised again for developing Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing. \n In a separate experiment involving three monkeys, Prof Qin and colleagues also found evidence to suggest people could be infected through the eyes. \n Dr Wang Guangfa, a senior medical expert from Beijin\ng, was infected after a trip to Wuhan to investigate the early outbreak despite wearing a face mask and other protective gear. \n Dr Wang suspected that the virus entered into his body through the eyes as he wiped sweat from his forehead, but had no evidence to support the theory. \n He later recovered at home in Beijing with relatively mild symptoms. \n To verify the theory, Prof Qin and colleagues dropped a solution containing the virus into two monkeys’ eyes. \n To their surprise, the researchers did not find the virus on the surface of the monkeys’ eyes the next day. But several days later, both animals tested positive. \n Further investigations showed that the viral strain might have landed on the conjunctiva, a tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white of the eye, and then travelled through the tear duct before ending up in the upper throat. \n However, the infection suffered by the monkeys appeared to be less severe than that of another animal that had caught the virus through the throat, according to another paper posted by Prof Qin on bioRxiv last Saturday. \n According to several other recent studies, the new coronavirus can survive in the air or on metal surfaces for days. \n The scientists wrote that their findings suggested that people should be more aware of the need to protect their eyes. \n They argued transmission could be cut by “regular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear when in close contact with patients or in crowded places, especially for clinicians”. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n"}, {"content": "China's controversial quarantine measures worked, prominent epidemiologist argues. BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - China's controversial quarantine measures limited the size of the country's Covid-19 outbreak and should be kept in place until late April, according to a study by a prominent Chinese epidemiologist. \n The study, led by Dr Zhong Nanshan, who has spearheaded China's effort against Covid-19, was published last month in China's Journal of Thoracic Disease, of which he is editor-in-chief. It defended various measures taken by China since late January to control the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns, forced quarantines and shutdowns of public transportation. \n Critics have charged that these moves were ineffective, violate the rights of individuals, and were too late to materialise after the discovery of the virus, and initial efforts to warn the public of its danger were suppressed. \n Yet Dr Zhong argued that these measures managed to quickly reduce the number of new cases. The study said that they also cut both the number of peak \"active infections,\" which refers to the number of people ill at the height of a region's epidemic, and the predicted total number of infections by the end of the epidemic. \n Nevertheless, at a Feb 27 press conference in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, Dr Zhong said that the paper had been rejected by at least one \"authoritative\" overseas medical journal, though he did not say which or why. \n Using a version of the \"susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered\" mathematical modelling technique, the study predicted that with the quarantine measures in force at the time of its publication, the epidemic in China would peak on Feb 28 with 59,764 cumulative active infections, dwindle by late April and result in about 122,122 cases in total by the end of the epidemic. \n This contrasts with modelling done by overseas infectious disease experts, with one study estimating the country's Covid-19 cases would reach 160,000 by early February. While Dr Zhong's figures more closely match China's official case numbers, Caixin has previously reported that the official tally excludes a significant portion of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, namely those without symptoms. \n According to Dr Zhong's team, a five-day delay in implementing the country's various lockdowns would have tripled the total number of infections in the country. Taken five days earlier, the measures would have cut the number of cases nationwide by two-thirds. \n Meanwhile the paper predicted that infections in Hubei, the province hardest hit by the outbreak, would peak on Feb 20 at 42,792 cases, then grow to a total of 59,578 by late April, when the outbreak is expected to near its end. \n Had interventions been delayed, both Hubei's active infections and total cases would have been over 2.6 times the current projected amount. Had the interventions been introduced five days earlier, the epidemic peak should have arrived five days earlier, with the total case number not exceeding 25,000. \n The study argues that if Hubei had ended its restrictions on movement after the extended Chinese New Year holiday concluded in early February, the province would have had a second peak in infections in March. \n The authors found similar trends for Guangdong and Zhejiang, two other provinces hit hard by the virus. \n \"The continued policy of 'early detection' and subsequent isolation might be effective in preventing a second epidemic wave in Guangdong and Zhejiang,\" the study said. \n The paper cautions that the return of migrants to Chinese cities, broadened testing and climate factors could affect the number of cases and that \"the policy of strict monitoring and early detection should remain in place until the end of April 2020.\" \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global.\n"}, {"content": "US summons Chinese envoy over coronavirus comments.

Much has been said about the 'perils' of Work From Home during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Yes, it is unbearable, in all honesty. Everybody is so done with life and sorry for making it worse, but we are just in the second day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown in India. But let's get this straight. There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help. You need to fend for your food, clean the house and do other chores after completing your shift. On the flipside though, did you ever think about the amount of money that you are saving while cribbing about the lockdown?\nThe silver lining, thus, on this cloud, is that if not anything else, you will walk out of this pandemic with some extra bucks in your bank account once the corona conundrum is done with.\nFor the sake of your sanity (and ours as well), we curated this list that will help you ascertain a rough estimate of the amount of money you are saving at the moment.\nTake a look:\nNO ZOMATO, NO SWIGGY\nYes, this is the worst thing about the lockdown. Not being able to order food online. Basically, coronavirus has ensured that even in this distressing situation, you cannot afford to feel bad for yourself and soothe your soul with some biryani, pizza or tandoori chicken for that matter. You just have to make do with ready-to-eat jazz or better still, cook for yourself. But thanks to Zomato and Swiggy stalling operations, you cannot even believe the amount of money you are saving. Come on, you know it. Till then, enjoy simple home-cooked food and you can gorge on Swiggy and Zomato once we are done with the pandemic.\nNO ONLINE SHOPPING\nWe understand it's frustrating not being able to shop online considering some people actually keep a part of their earnings aside every month to do this. None of the e-commerce websites are delivering stuff but look at the brighter side of the story. You can use all the money that you had kept aside to shop tons of stuff once services resume. Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well. Moreover, you are working from home and aren't even stepping out for recreation. So, no expenses for conveyance either. Make no mistake, because you are saving big time here.\nNO RECREATIONAL EXPENSES\nWhen was the last time you opened your wardrobe and wore a fancy dress for an outing? Well, the answer should explain that our only outing has been from the bedroom to the kitchen and vice-versa and that too, in our pyjamas. No partying with friends. No shopping at malls or indulging in delectable dishes at restaurants. Nothing, actually. Right now, it is all about you and your tanhai, and not to forget, kaafi saara paisa in the bank account.\nBEST USE OF RESOURCES\nIn order to avoid stepping out, it is ideal to make do with what you have. Everybody is basically making the best use of their resources, and although grocery stores are open, you are reconsidering heading out until absolutely necessary. With that, you are actually cutting out on a lot of unnecessary expenses. Do the math.\nSo, don't be surprised with your increased bank balance. Celebrate yourself, instead, for pulling off this major challenge with ultimate ease.

Singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early February, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe.\nWithin weeks, the country's tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in South Korea, several European countries and the U.S.\nSome strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. East Asia's experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, has likewise helped.\nSince testing rates vary widely, it's hard to know for sure. But Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.\nSingapore's first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in late December.\nBy mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n\"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\"\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China\nfrom attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO's research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \"We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\" he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore's Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said Pangestu. \"Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" Lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\"\n"}, {"content": "Disabled youth dies in China after their father is quarantined due to coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US will begin screening passengers on Friday (Jan 17) arriving from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious Sars-linked virus, officials said, after an outbreak that has stricken dozens claimed a second life. \n Three confirmed cases, meanwhile, have now been reported outside China - two in Thailand and one in Japan - even as health authorities around the world sought to assure the public that the overall risk of infection remained low. \n Martin Cetron, a senior official at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters: \"To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry.\" \n These are San Francisco airport and New York's JFK, which both receive direct flights, as well as Los Angeles, the biggest destination for connecting flights, he said, adding: \"We're expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5000 people\" beginning Friday night. \n Incoming travellers will be asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check, with those showing possible signs of infection sent on to another facility for a diagnostic test that could take up to a day. \n The move came after Chinese officials said the infection had claimed its second death: a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday in Wuhan, the central Chinese city believed to be the epicentre of an outbreak of the pathogen from the same family as the deadly Sars virus. \n No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has said the possibility \"cannot be excluded.\" \n The enigmatic illness has caused alarm because of its connection to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Pneumonia linked to the new virus has hit at least 41 people in China, with the outbreak centered around a seafood market in Wuhan. \n Of these 12 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the Wuhan health commission, while five others are in a serious condition. \n The second man to die became sick on Dec 31 and his condition worsened two weeks ago, it said, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions. \n Thailand reported its second case of the coronavirus on Friday: a 74-year-old Chinese woman who had arrived from Wuhan earlier this week. \n Her condition is improving, said Thai health officials, who urged people not to panic as there was \"no spread of the virus\" in the South-east Asian country. \n That sentiment was echoed by senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, who said: \"For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something that they generally need to worry about.\" \n Yet, much remains to be understood about the \"2019 novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV,\" according to the CDC, which added that \"there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred.\" \n The latest fatality comes as China prepares for its busiest travel season of the year next week, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Chinese New Year. \n China has not announced any travel restrictions but authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers. \n The Wuhan health commission said one man who had been diagnosed worked at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but his wife, who also had the virus, reported \"no history of exposure\" at the facility. \n The first case in Thailand had not reported visiting the seafood market, the WHO said Tuesday. The woman was reported to be in a stable condition earlier this week. \n The patient in Japan, who was released from hospital, had also not visited the market. Japanese officials said it was possible that the man had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan. \n After the second death was reported, online discussion spread in China over the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus - and how much information the government is hiding from the public. \n Several complained about censorship of online posts, while others made comparisons to 2003, when Beijing drew criticism from the WHO for under-reporting the number of Sars cases. \n \"It's so strange,\" wrote a web user on the social media platform Weibo, citing the ov\nerseas cases in Japan and Thailand. \"They all have Wuhan pneumonia cases but (in China) we don't have any infections outside of Wuhan - is that scientific?\" \n But the CDC's Messonnier thanked her Chinese counterparts for quickly identifying the pathogen and making its genome publicly available to scientists around the world, allowing them to rapidly develop diagnostic tools.\n"}, {"content": "Angola among the 13 countries with top priority for surveillance due to coronavirus.

All public hospital emergency departments here are in \"outbreak response mode\" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious, Sars-like virus that is spreading in China. \n \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore,\" Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\" which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\". \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, no\nt out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters.

Climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. But despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current Covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change. \n While the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. Nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare “war” on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease. \n With climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government’s resource allocation decisions. \n In short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them more likely. \n In dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from Covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks — much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death. \n On the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. How do we explain this paradox? \n PROBABILITY NEGLECT, PRESENT BIAS AND GLOBAL COMMONS \n Our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect. \n When dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect heuristic). \n The coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. It also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. Salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is. \n Climate change is exactly the opposite. It is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. Climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. Being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated. \n The result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the “war” against the Covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities. \n Global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections. \n The different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. People tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts. \n In the case of the coronavirus, people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.  \n With climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.  \n Climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. Effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.  \n But such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. \n With epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \n With climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable. \n The benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world). \n LESSONS FOR CLIMATE ACTION \n First, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute cli\nmate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.  \n Our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: “If you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.” \n Second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks. \n For example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise. \n Third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. With the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.  \n With climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore. \n Finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.  \n That the coronavirus began in China, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for China to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. By doing so, China would also reduce the risks of future epidemics. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Donald Low is senior lecturer and professor of practice in public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Xun Wu is professor and head of the Division of Public Policy.

LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Here are some key features of viruses and the new coronavirus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and is causing an outbreak of disease in China and beyond.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to “self-sustaining” human-to-human transmission. They estimate that each infected person is infecting, on average, two to three more people.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people.

That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged. \n The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church.

On Feb 18, just five weeks ago, I started my Budget 2020 speech setting out what we must do to combat the threats posed by the Covid-19 outbreak. At that time, there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China. \n The outbreak has escalated quickly. Three weeks after my Budget speech, on March 11, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic, recognising the severity and risk of further global spread. \n Today, the WHO estimates that the number of people infected has exceeded 410,000, across more than 190 countries. \n The Covid-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts - medical, economic and social. \n First, on the medical front, countries are taking extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus, so that their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. Many countries have implemented lockdowns, while the United States has declared a national emergency. \n In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. We acted early and decisively. As the severity of the virus outbreak grew worldwide, we stepped up our measures. This has, so far, helped to keep the number of cases at manageable levels during the first wave. \n However, as much as we try, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions would last even longer. The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. We must be prepared to take further tougher measures. \n Yet, measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle - the economic front - even more difficult. These public health measures have caused severe economic disruptions and uncertainties. As more countries implement their measures, the economic disruptions will be wider, deeper and more prolonged. \n The global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock. \n On the supply side, supply chains have been disrupted as locked-down workers are unable to work. With highly integrated global supply chains, a disruption in any one part of the chain, or in any one country, will have knock-on effects worldwide. \n Passengers at Changi Airport on Monday, one in a protective suit, mask and shoe covers. The extraordinary situation of the pandemic calls for extraordinary measures, says Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. PHOTO: REUTERS \n On the demand side, aggregate demand has fallen as people stay home and curtail spending. Consumer and business confidence are plunging in the face of growing uncertainties. \n The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its 2020 global growth forecast three times since January 2019, and flagged that a further downgrade is imminent in April. It added that it expects a recession at least as bad as during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Global financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties and cutback in economic activity. Stock markets have come down from their peak some weeks ago. \n The S&P 500 index took only 22 trading days to fall by 30 per cent from its peak, making it the fastest drop of this magnitude in history. The key volatility indices in Europe and the US, which some call the \"fear index\", briefly reached levels last seen during the global financial crisis. \n Credit has tightened across the world, and the US yield curve has fallen below 1 per cent for the first time in history. The disruptions around the world will significantly curtail global demand, disrupt supply chains, and possibly lead to financial shocks. As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, we will be deeply impacted by these global shocks. \n Based on advance gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released this morning, in the first quarter, the Singapore economy contracted by 10.6 per cent quarter on quarter, or 2.2 per cent year on year, reversing the 0.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter. \n This morning, the Ministry of Trade and Industry further downgraded Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2020, from a range of minus 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced last month, to between minus 4 per cent and minus 1 per cent. \n This extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures. \n Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our front-line agencies. \n Today,\nI will introduce measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the situation at hand. This is over seven times of the first tranche. \n Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation. \n The Government has sought and obtained the President's in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion from our past reserves to fund part of the Resilience Budget. \n The Resilience Budget focuses on three key areas: \n •First, save jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods. \n •Second, help enterprises overcome immediate challenges. \n •Third, strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger. \n Let me now elaborate on our considerations for drawing on past reserves in this budget, and our fiscal position after the measures that I have put forth to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. \n Our reserves are our strategic asset, built up through the discipline and prudence of our people and political leaders, across generations. \n Our reserves serve as our bulwark against shocks and crises of an extraordinary nature. For a nation with no oil, no gas, no gold, no diamonds, or natural resources of any kind, it is remarkable that we have built this up. \n Our prudence and discipline in saving and growing our reserves give us the wherewithal to respond decisively when our nation faces extraordinary circumstances. \n Our founding fathers created a rigorous framework to ensure that such strategic assets are used only for the right purpose. We amended the Constitution in 1991 to provide for an elected president who is the custodian of our past reserves. \n Under Article 148A of the Constitution, the President can withhold her assent to any supply Bill if she is of the view that it is likely to draw on past reserves. \n Our principle is that each term of government must live within its means. Any additional spending that the government of the day proposes must be funded in a sustainable manner - recurrent expenditures should be funded from recurrent revenues. \n Past reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the President, after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers, agrees with the Government's proposal to draw on the past reserves in exceptional situations. \n Despite political pressure to dip into the reserves, the Government has scrupulously upheld the principle that past reserves are to be used only for exceptional situations. \n Until now, the Government has drawn on past reserves only once, during the global financial crisis, when the President approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme and special risk-sharing initiative. \n During that period, the Government also sought the President's concurrence to use $150 billion of past reserves to back the deposit guarantee scheme. I was at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) at that time. We had asked for this, and it took us a long time to deliberate on this. As it turned out, the guarantee was not triggered, and there was no draw on past reserves. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, and the multiple threats it poses to our nation, is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for. \n We have saved up for a rainy day. The Covid-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing. \n If over the years we had frittered the reserves away, on more immediate but less existential needs, big and small, as some in this House have pressed the Government to do, we would be in a much weaker position today. \n We are experiencing a confluence of multiple external shocks - a pandemic that has triggered many nations to shut their borders, limit exports and halt economic activities, in order to fight this pandemic. \n This economic impact is magnified, as the global economy is already fragile, and further weakened by a protracted US-China trade conflict, and an oil price war. \n So this is not a normal business cycle that we would have anticipated and dealt with using the revenues collected by each term of government. It is a \"black swan\" event that comes only once every few decades. \n In view of the exceptional circumstances, the Government has sought the President's in-principle support to use past reserves to fund part of the package. \n The Covid-19 situation is fluid and fast-moving, and nobody is quite sure how it will\ndevelop. But because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence. \n We will use our resources to get through this together. \n The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely. Should it become necessary, I am prepared to propose to the President further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation. I trust that every member of this House will deeply internalise the mission to be careful stewards of our reserves. \n The measures that I have announced today will raise the overall Budget deficit for FY2020 to $39.2 billion (7.9 per cent of GDP). We are able to support this unprecedented deficit, and still remain fiscally sustainable, because we have been disciplined in the use of past reserves, tapping them only in exceptional circumstances like these. \n The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with significant risks. Our fiscal position will be affected from both the revenue and expenditure sides. \n With a weak GDP outlook, our revenues will be affected. Sentiment-driven revenues may come down sharply. \n While revenues are coming down, our expenditure will be going up, to enable us to respond effectively to the crisis. In the past few years, we benefited from unexpected revenue upsides, such as exceptional statutory board contributions from MAS and increased stamp duty collections. We cannot hope to rely on a repeat of this. Instead, we must be prepared to bear the down sides when they happen. Because we have been prudent and did not decide to spend all of the surplus that we collected, we are ready to meet such downsides. \n We can expect significant volatility in the economy, and in financial markets, in the near future. We will need to continue to review our expenditure plans very carefully in this fluid situation. We will adopt a nimble fiscal posture, so that we can quickly channel the resources at hand to the most urgent and important needs of our people. \n The Covid-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation. \n It has put all countries around the world to the test - on the medical, economic and social fronts. \n We have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in Singapore, because we have forged a cohesive, resilient society. The whole nation has come together in response. Our healthcare and front-line workers are working tirelessly to care for the infected. Our cleaners are doing humble but heroic work to keep our environment clean. \n Thousands of public officers are working round the clock to respond to the threat of Covid-19. The private sector and corporations too have stepped forward. \n Individuals are doing their part - vloggers and bloggers are helping to share public messages, others are volunteering, giving support and encouragement and, crucially, by complying with health advisories and practising safe distancing. These include foreigners who live among us and who care deeply about Singapore. \n Many have also had to make sacrifices in this time. Families have had to make difficult adjustments to their lives, some having to undergo quarantine, cancel celebrations or put off other long-awaited plans, including wedding plans. \n And despite our best efforts to work with businesses and unions to save jobs, some workers have suffered a loss of income or jobs. \n The Government and the political leadership are in this with Singaporeans. We share the worries and anxieties of Singaporeans, and we will do our best for you. \n To show solidarity with Singaporeans, I announced at the Budget debate last month that the political leadership will take a one-month pay cut. With the deteriorating situation, we will go further. All political office-holders will take an additional pay cut of two months, altogether a three-month cut in their salary. \n The President, Speaker and both deputy Speakers have informed me that they will join in, and take a similar three-month pay cut in total. \n It is in times of crisis that the true character of a nation can be seen. \n The months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. We must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario. \n The Government will lead the way. We will do our best to anticipate and respond to developments, make decisions based on facts and evidence, and exercise judgment when there are trade-offs. \n While we attend to the immediate and urgent tasks, we\nwill set our sights on the long term, so that Singapore comes out of this crisis stronger as a nation. \n We will protect and advance the well-being and livelihoods of Singaporeans. We will take care of our people. We will leave no one behind. And we will stand with Singaporeans of all walks of life to battle this crisis, together. \n We are all in this together. And we must all look after one another in these trying times. \n This is the essence of who we are as a nation. This is the essence of who we are as a people. This is SG United. This is SG Together! \n Read Mr Heng's full speech here.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: first confirmed case in Germany, second European country where he was diagnosed.

Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV.

In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people.

The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAccording to its own information, the WHO opposes the dissemination of false information concerning the new virus.

There are many social networks in contact with them. \"We have asked them to filter out false information and to promote correct information from reliable sources.\" On Instagram and YouTube, the WHO has also sought contact with influenza sufferers and influenza sufferers and has asked them to spread factual news about the virus. According to Tedros, the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region.\nAccording to a study by Chinese scientists, the novel virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan would have had diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of fever symptoms and difficulty breathing, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe course of the disease started with diarrhoea and nausea for ten percent of 138 patients, writes the scientists. They indicated that in the early cases of the first disease in Wuhan in December they were all on respiratory\ng symptoms. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract may have been overlooked.\nThe Sars virus, which is also caused by coronary viruses, was also partially transmitted during the epidemic at the beginning of the zero years.

Health officials have warned that the Wuhan outbreak has reached a \"critical stage\", as the virus mutates and the outbreak continues to spread to more provinces, territories and countries. \n The United States and Macau registered their first cases yesterday, while infected people have been identified for the first time in Hainan, Fujian, Liaoning and Anhui, widening the number of affected provinces to more than 20. \n Hong Kong reported that a man had preliminarily tested positive for the virus, but a final test result would be known only today. \n The authorities fear the number of cases will soar as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel across or out of the country during the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The death toll climbed to 17 and, as of last night, at least 540 people have tested positive for the 2019-nCoV virus, which scientists have determined is part of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) family. \n The National Health Commission's emergency management office director Xu Shuqiang said the country is at a critical stage in its battle to stop the viral outbreak from turning into a pandemic. \n The virus is believed to have originated from wild animals sold illegally at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei province, where the first wave of patients had worked at, said virologist Gao Fu. \n \"From animal to human, the virus has adapted and evolved. The relationship between viruses and humans is like a cat and mouse game,\" said Professor Gao, who is director-general of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. \n While experts said the biggest worry is the emergence of super-spreaders, Prof Gao said there is no evidence of these highly infectious individuals yet, even though 14 healthcare workers were infected by one single carrier in Wuhan. \n The World Health Organisation identifies a super-spreader as someone who infects more than 10 secondary contacts. \n \"We will be monitoring closely because there is the possibility of super-spreaders,\" said Prof Gao. \n Wuhan Mayor Zhang Xianwang said the 14 healthcare workers - a doctor and 13 nurses - were infected by a patient in a neurosurgery ward who had not been tested for the new coronavirus. He developed a fever only after his surgery. \n \"That was a very profound lesson,\" said Mr Zhang, who has appealed to people not to travel in or out of the city. \n More than 90 per cent of the infection cases have been in Wuhan. The central Chinese city of 11 million has been on high alert as the authorities step up checks on travellers and vehicles. \n All trading of wildlife has been banned, and restaurants have been prohibited from serving dishes with the animals. \n News that the disease is now being spread through human contact sent jitters across cities, as people rushed out to buy face masks and disinfectants. Phar-macies in Beijing and Shanghai ran low on stocks, especially after the country launched a nationwide hygiene campaign. \n Beijing-based insurance agent Kevin Tu, 40, was bent on going home to Wuhan today to spend the new year with his parents. But he sought a refund for his air ticket yesterday after his parents insisted that he stay put in the capital city. \n \"They were worried about my safety, but I am worried about theirs too. I have told them to stay home as much as possible, and to avoid crowded places,\" Mr Tu, an only child, told The Straits Times. \n On Monday, the health commission upgraded the Wuhan pneumonia to a Class B infectious disease, which puts it in the same category as Sars. But it is handling the outbreak with stricter measures under a Class A category, which stipulates that an infection anywhere in the country must be reported within two hours. \n The Class A classification also allows for greater resources to be mobilised. \n Ms Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said while there are hospitals currently designated for treating the pneumonia patients, the authorities' contingency plans include backup hospitals in case the epidemic becomes widespread. \n Front-line medical workers including Chinese traditional medi-cine practitioners in Beijing told ST that they have been made to cancel their Chinese New Year leave to be on standby since Tuesday. \n Hospitals in the capital city have set up pre-screening triages, and suspected cases are transferred to fever clinics. \"We just hope this battle will pass soon,\" said Chinese traditional medicine physici\nan Jia Xiaoming, 30.\n"}, {"content": "Sale of masks soars in Delhi as city alarmed over coronavirus threat.

Another eight patients have tested negative and they have been discharged.\nWhere masks are still available, in Connaught Place, for instance, long queues formed at the stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers.\nShops that have run out of N95 masks have no idea as to when their next delivery would arrive. Vendors of medical supplies said that masks were becoming harder to source. Uttam, a medical store owner near RML Hospital, confirmed that there has been a surge in the demand for masks after coronavirus cases were reported in India. \"We have sold around 10,000 masks in a week. These include both N95 and surgical masks. N95s are out of stock at the moment,\" he said.\nPawan, another medical store owner near RML Hospital, admitted that the increase in demand has spiked prices. \"A plain mask which used to cost Rs 5 is now being sold at Rs 10. Also, we used to buy one N95 for Rs 100. Now we're not getting it even for Rs 150,\" he said.\nMedical supply vendors said people who cannot get N95 masks are buying regular ones. However, according to Dr Sandeep Nayar, HOD, Respiratory Medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, regular masks do not protect people from the Chinese virus.\n\"Only special masks like N95 or N99 can prevent coronavirus infection. These too should be tightly worn. Mouth and nose should be properly covered,\" he said.\nLast week, India banned exports of all kinds of personal protection equipment, including masks. The move aims at meeting the rising demand for such products.\nTHE EXPORT BAN \nOn Friday, the All India Food and Drug Licence Association (AFDLH) had sought a ban on the export of surgical and N95 masks as they were not available in local markets.\n\"Manufacturers are getting huge orders for these masks which are being sold for 10-times more than their actual price. Due to this, Indian citizens will find it difficult to get these masks when needed. Hence the export and the price of these masks should be controlled,\" AFDLH had written to the government.\n\"Given the high and lucrative demand internationally, manufacturers are ignoring the need in local markets and were busy in meeting the export demands. These trade activities had put Indians at the risk of not getting the masks to be safe from this virus. So, we demanded the government to ban its export and regulate the prices,\" said Abhay Pande, president, AFDLH.\nThe N95 respirator is designed to fit very closely to the face and, as a result, more efficiently filters airborne particles. The N95 face mask is available online but delivery can take up to two weeks, making it a less feasible option for customers.\nAt a high-level meeting on Monday, Health Ministry officials said that adequate materials like personal protection equipment (PPE) and N95 masks are available and the Centre is closely monitoring the situation in all states and Union Territories. coronavirus causes a flu-like severe respiratory ailment and can spread from person to person by airborne droplets that an infected person expels when sneezing or coughing.\n\"One must avoid direct contact with those suspected to have been infected by coronavirus. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose if you have not washed your hands properly. Cover your face while coughing or sneezing with a tissue,\" Nayar said.\nCENTRAL GOVT SWINGS INTO ACTION \nMeanwhile, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was formed on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It held a meeting to review the preparedness to contain the spread of the virus in the country. The GoM includes Union ministers Harsh Vardhan, Hardeep Singh Puri, S Jaishankar, G Kishan Reddy, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nThe ministers were apprised of the three confirmed cases reported from Kerala and the preventive steps and measures taken to contain coronavirus.\nThe GoM also took note of the government announcing a temporary suspension of the e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in the neighbouring country and a fresh advisory saying anyone with travel history to China since January 15 c\nan be quarantined.\nThe government has also advised that people having compelling reasons to visit India should contact the Indian embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai or Guangzhou.\nSo far 645 people have been transported to India from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. They have been admitted to quarantine centres of the Army and the ITBP in and around the National Capital.\nTests conducted for coronavirus on 406 people, who were evacuated to Delhi from China's Wuhan city to an ITBP facility in Chhawla area, have been negative till now, a senior official of the border guarding force said. The Kerala government has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a state calamity with a third student testing positive for the infection in the state. The decision was taken at the apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose. Two earlier positive cases, also of students who came back from Wuhan, were reported from Thrissur and Alapuzha districts.\nMeanwhile, the death toll in China soared to 425 with 64 deaths on Monday while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 20,400, Chinese health officials announced on Monday.\n"}, {"content": "it’s ‘battle against nature’ for covid-19 and more time is needed to learn about disease: moh official. SINGAPORE — The Covid-19 disease appears to be “containable” based on the measures that some countries, including Singapore, have taken to combat the coronavirus outbreak, even though much is still unknown about it, said the director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n “China, Hong Kong, Singapore have (put in place) quite a few different measures and different styles of containment, and they seem to be reducing the number of new cases. \n “So perhaps it is not quite as transmissible as influenza,” Dr Vernon Lee said on Tuesday (Feb 25) at a panel discussing how Singapore has responded to the Covid-19 outbreak so far.   \n However, he stressed repeatedly that more time is needed to understand the transmission and the severity characteristics of Covid-19.  \n “Time will tell. I think we still need to learn more about this disease.” \n Dr Lee, who is also an adjunct associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, was one of four panellists at the discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and streamed live on its Facebook page. \n The others were economist Barnabas Gan from the United Overseas Bank (UOB); Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow at IPS; and Dr Shashi Jayakumar, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). \n They delved into how Singapore has dealt with the medical, economic, and social impact of the public health emergency. \n Dr Lee was asked by Dr Gillian Koh, moderator and deputy director of research at IPS, to give his take on how medical science and epidemiologists around the world are dealing with the new coronavirus, which had its first outbreak in Wuhan of China’s Hubei province in December last year. \n In response, he said it is unprecedented the way in which the amount of information known about Covid-19 has ballooned in the past two months, but there are still several unknowns.  \n “It is a battle against nature, and with time, some of these answers will be clearer.” \n When it came to establishing the mortality rate of the disease, for example, it is challenging to detect milder cases of Covid-19, which may also skew the statistics on case fatality rates by several magnitudes, he said. \n In Singapore, more than 10 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, which “is certainly concerning”, Dr Lee said. \n “Because of the sheer number of people that are affected across the globe, (Covid-19) still caused many deaths. So we do not want to trivialise any virus because it has some potential impact.” \n  From left: Dr Gillian Koh, Dr Vernon Lee, Mr Barnabas Gan, Dr Carol Soon and Dr Shashi Jayakumar at a panel discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies. Photo: Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore   \n TOURISM LOSS COULD WIPE OUT 2020 ECONOMIC GAINS \n Since the time needed to fully learn about Covid-19 may be protracted, the economic impact of this disease can be significant, considering that Singapore’s economy was affected only across a single quarter during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003, Mr Gan said. \n Before the outbreak arrived in Singapore, UOB predicted that Singapore’s economy would grow by 1.5 per cent this year. \n However, current economic figures now point to a 25 to 30 per cent fall in tourism arrivals, which could work out to a S$6.8 billion to S$8.1 billion fall in tourism receipts this year due to the viral outbreak, he said. This is equivalent to the 1.5 per cent growth that UOB predicted earlier for 2020. \n “That will completely wipe out our GDP (gross domestic product) and bring it to around 0.5 per cent, just based on how much our tourism receipts actually fall,” he said.  \n Dr Koh noted that the fall could be greater, given the impact on other non-tourism sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, retail, and food-and-beverage. She asked Mr Gan whether the measures announced during Budget 2020 were enough to bolster Singapore through this period. \n In his Budget speech last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat had announced that the Government will set aside a total of S$6.4 billion to help workers, firms, households and frontline agencies tackle Covid-19. \n Mr Gan said some people have noted that a few measures came with a short time span, such as the three-month period for the\nJobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers, but the Government has around S$8 billion more up its sleeve in accumulated surpluses during the current term of government. This kitty could be used to “push up” the economy if needed, he said. \n SINGAPOREANS HAVE TO FACE A ‘SLOW-BURN’ CRISIS \n On how the people here have reacted, Dr Soon and Dr Jayakumar said that Singaporeans need to be able to prepare emotionally for health pandemics, which Dr Jayakumar described as a “slow-burn” crisis. \n Dr Soon noted that three types of misinformation emerged during this outbreak. These are factual misinformation, such as the false rumours of MRT station closures; misleading advisories such as unproven home remedies being shared online; and xenophobic, racist sentiments that have no basis in fact, which are observed both overseas and in Singapore. \n She said that Singapore has been effective in trying to plug information gaps about the virus through “a very interesting and relatively efficacious playbook”.  \n Besides daily updates about the spread of the virus, the Government reinforces key messages through different channels, such as through various government ministries, the media, and experts to help people dissect the situation. \n It has also wielded the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) to counter Covid-19 falsehoods in a way that most people agree with, she said. \n Government spokespersons were also quick to counter rumours, she added, noting how Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had come out at one point to categorically refute talk that the authorities were going to raise the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition from Orange level to Red. \n Still, more can be done, she said. While the Government has been providing updates usually at a certain time each day, on some days, the information may arrive later in the evening. This may create suspicions, Dr Soon said. \n “Where there is an information gap, people will rely on heuristics — mental shortcuts — to plug the gaps,” she added.  \n Dr Jayakumar said that while Singapore is prepared for one-off incidents such as terrorist attacks, the Government, academics and think-tanks should do more to look at how the country can bounce back from slow-burn crises such as pandemics and climate change. \n “In my point of view, it is almost problematic that Singapore is so safe, clean and secure.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information fr\nom the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction. If there’s no direction, there’s no hope.”\n"}, {"content": "Social distancing due to coronavirus: Satellite data suggest no large-scale decrease in emissions in India. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, has forced countries across the world to take extreme steps - one of these has been a complete lockdown of cities.\nBoth China and Italy adopted these extreme measures in order to contain the outbreak once it went out of control. While there is no conclusive way to quantify the effect of restricted human activity, its imprint on atmosphere is somewhat measurable.\nScientists have observed a pattern which links a decreased level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), first over China and now over Italy, since the implementation of mass quarantines.\nNitrogen dioxide is usually emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities such as motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities.\nBoth National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and European Space Agency (ESA) experts link the decrease in NO2 levels with an effective decrease in machine-run activities in these areas.\nWHAT ABOUT INDIA?\nIndia has taken several steps to contain the spreading of the novel coronavirus - state governments as well as Union governments have issued multiple advisories and orders to restrict community spread, as much as possible.\nBelow are NO2 levels on February 7.\nBelow are NO2 levels on March 16,\nMost administrations have ordered closing educational institutions, cinema halls and cancelled sporting events.\nWhile there are no strict orders against domestic movements and industrial gatherings, the government has advised citizens to avoid travel and meetings.\nEven Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged people to work from home.\nHowever, satellite data from the ESA show that there is negligible reduction in NO2 levels.\nThe data was collected between February 17 to March 16, 2020. This shows that despite all the advisories, the reduction in overall outdoor human activities in India has not been enough to leave a large imprint in the atmosphere.\nThis, however, may not be the exact assessment of all the activities happening on the ground, but it gives a sense of a quantifiable changes caused in the atmosphere due to large-scale human activities. Although, the situation in India is nowhere similar to that in China or Europe, these governments along with those of the UK and USA have been criticised for not taking similar measures sooner.\nWhen it comes to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the global science community has reached a consensus that no step is enough and preemptive measures are more effective in these situations.\nWhile experts world over are advising the governments to take more drastic measures to contain the outbreak into new areas, large-scale isolation and absence of public gatherings have shown effective results.\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 11-China reports big rise in coronavirus deaths, WHO sees no 'tip of iceberg'. BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China’s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine’s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: here\nFor related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nJapan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness.\nThe Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.\nHowever, the big jump in China’s reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients’ chest images, and is not necessarily the “tip of an iceberg” of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\nMike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.\n“We’ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,” the WHO’s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. “I think they’ve handled it professionally, and I think they’re extremely capable,” Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump’s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. “We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,” he told reporters.\nIn central China’s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary\nof the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam’s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.\n"}, {"content": "False claim: 5G networks are making people sick, not Coronavirus. Facebook users have been sharing posts claiming 5G, not the coronavirus, is making people sick (  here  ).\nThe posts go on to include a list of various further claims that deny the reality of the virus and include various conspiracy-type arguments about the coronavirus.\nThe coronavirus outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The Center for Disease Control says on its website the virus had links to a \"seafood and live animal market\" where a human might have contracted the virus from an animal. The virus then spread person-to-person (  here  ). The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath that can appear  two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus (  here  ). The coronavirus is spread person-to-person (  here  ).\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs). 5G uses \"beam-forming technology\", which allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed (  here  ).\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) after 7 years of research released 2020 guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields. They include information about 5G.\nThe commission says the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases to body temperature, such as through exercising, but radiofrequency exposure and increased temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold (  here  ).\nAccording to the ICNIRP, \"Another general characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. As 5G technologies can utilize higher EMF frequencies (>24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (<4 GHz), power from those higher frequencies will be primarily absorbed more superficially than that from previous mobile telecommunications technologies […] Accordingly, 5G exposures will not cause any harm providing that they adhere to the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, Chairman of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause health effects such as cancer, electrohypersensitivity, infertility or anything else. The only two recognized health effects are nerve stimulation in up to 10 MHz and heating from 100 kHz (  here  ).\nThe World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (  here  ). WHO said on its website it will continue to review research in this area and is conducting a \"health risk assessment\" of all radiofrequency ranges that will be available in 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics, said there is no basis to expect that 5G would cause adverse health issues provided exposure limits are respected.\nZiskin told Reuters, “The weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative. That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect. I would add that there have been no health agency warnings about possible health risks of RF energy including millimeter waves at exposure levels that an average consumer would experience from communications technology. This is consistent with assessments of the issue by standards-setting groups such as IEEE and ICNIRP.”\nCoronavirus symptoms can be found in detail on official government and international health organization sites. They bear no similarity to possible health effects stemming from mobile phone or 5G use.\nFalse: There is no connection between the outbreak of COVID-19 and possible 5G health effects.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains,\" it said.\n\"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy,\" Moody's added.\nThe death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flig\nhts to the country.\n"}, {"content": "Businesses in faraway Namibia feel coronavirus fear.

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key United States public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of US-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learnt. \n Most of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. \n The Atlanta-based CDC, America's pre-eminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years. \n The CDC's China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staff members, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. \n The material reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. \n The documents are the CDC's own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \n \"The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,\" said one of the people, a US official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown. \n Separately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief programme which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Mr Trump's watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a US official. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) transferred the manager of an animal disease monitoring programme out of China in 2018. \n Reductions at the US agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the US government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping US experts from entering the country to assist. \n \"We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\" said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of US personnel. \"You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\" \n The White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the US withdrawal of staff in China. \n The CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the US response to the coronavirus. \n \"There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\" the CDC said in a statement. \n Some health experts were sceptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticised for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. \n \"The problem was China, not that we didn't have CDC people in China,\" said Dr Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China's censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. \n China's embassy in Washington, DC declined to comment. \n The NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on \"sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\" \n A USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was \"due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency's position\nthat the Chinese model of development is not aligned with US values and interests\". \n The USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \"trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,\" the spokesman said. \n Reuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a US trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. \n In a press briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump criticised the Reuters story as \"100 per cent wrong\". Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China's \"excellent technical capability,\" and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the US effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. \n The CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. \n The documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staff members. The number of so-called American \"assignees\" declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases. \n The biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the US payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. \n \"Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,\" one of the people said. \"There's a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\" \n The CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training programme, according to the statement. \n The shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. \n USAID's Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior US officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019. \n The NSF office was once led by Dr Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the US and Chinese scientific communities, according to the US government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staff members. \n \"She had far more contacts than most of us,\" said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. \"She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\" \n Dr Sung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency's public affairs office. \n The changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Mr Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other's goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. \n Mr Trump has called it the \"Chinese virus\" to keep the focus on China's role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries. \n Over the last two years, the White House has pushed US agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programmes there along with the positions to manage them, according to the US official who spoke to Reuters. \n The source said Mr Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the US presence in China but was told to \"get with t\nhe programme\" by an administration official. \n \"The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the US,\" the source said. \n A State Department spokesman said in a statement that the US Embassy in China is \"one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement\". \n \"Since Ambassador Branstad's arrival, the US Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,\" the statement said. \"Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\" \n After Reuters' story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Mr Trump's re-election campaign seized on it for fund raising. In a mass e-mail to supporters, it accused Mr Trump's critics of \"siding with the Chinese\" and helping Beijing with a \"cover-up\". \n The CDC on Monday told Reuters that its director Dr Robert Redfield had decided to add a global health threats programme director to its China staff. \n \"At the request of Dr Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC's 30 plus year presence in China,\" the statement said.\n"}, {"content": "India reports first case of Coronavirus; Kerala woman tests positive.

Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus in India: 44 infected so far, virus reaches Punjab, Karnataka and J&K | 10 developments.

SINGAPORE — Tired and hungry after a long day at work, Mr Derrick Tay was looking forward to returning home for a warm shower, having something to eat and watching Netflix in bed.  \n But something caught his attention while he was mindlessly thumbing through his phone in the train around 9pm on Friday a week ago: Images of shoppers making a mad dash for groceries at supermarkets across the island.  \n While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), it was a scene that no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.  \n Just hours earlier, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange. \n The Dorscon level was raised after several Covid-19 cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China.  \n “I was shocked by what I saw on my phone. When I got home, I told my parents about it,” Mr Tay, 31, said. \n His mother had planned to do her weekly grocery run on Saturday but he told her to do it that night as he “wasn’t sure if there would be anything left for her to buy in the morning at the rate people were wiping out the shelves”.   \n  Customers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, 2020, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n The mother and son then headed to their neighbourhood’s mini-mart in Choa Chu Kang.  \n “It was crazy that day. I’ve never seen so many people inside before, and at such a late hour. There was a queue that wound around the inside of the store,” said Mr Tay, who ended up having to wait for more than 30 minutes to pay for his purchases.  \n His basket of groceries held a bag of rice, four packs of assorted instant noodle flavours, a bottle of oil and several cans of tuna and sardine. \n His 72-year-old mother, who helped carry two bags’ worth of toilet paper, told him that she could not remember Singaporeans panicking like this. \n Despite reassurances from government leaders including Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing who took to Facebook to call for calm, Mr Tay and many Singaporeans were not entirely assured as the panic buying continued through the night. \n In fact, Mr Tay was still in the queue when he read Mr Chan’s Facebook post but he went on to complete his purchases.  \n He told TODAY that his actions were partly shaped by the mask situation. The Government had made clear that it has a stockpile of masks but this did not prevent long queues or stocks running out at shops and pharmacies.    \n What happened was that the Government had released five million masks to retailers over nine days last month but these were sold out within hours. As a result, the Government decided to distribute the masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. At the same time, it has reiterated that there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are well and it is more important to practise good personal hygiene such as washing hands.  \n Singapore, like many countries, has been grappling with a mask shortage since the health crisis started, sparked by a sudden surge in demand. \n  The Government has distributed masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n While many like Mr Tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the Government.  \n And even if supplies are in no danger of running out, Mr Tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared.  \n “Anyway, if there’s no emergency, we’ll just take it as having done a few days’ worth of shopping beforehand,” he said.  \n While Mr Tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively measured compared to the others: Pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat.    \n Still, some like Dr Paul Tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did.  \n Noting\nthat Singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, Dr Tambyah – who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection – noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance.   \n “As far as I know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,” he said. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?   \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n As of Friday, Singapore has 67 confirmed cases of Covid-19 — the highest outside of China where the vast majority of cases are concentrated.  \n Including Hong Kong and Macau, China has reported almost 64,000 cases to date and the count continues to rise.  \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.  Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.  \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n Mr Wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in Hong Kong. “Now you can’t find rice anywhere,” said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry. \n Unlike Macau or mainland China, there are no regulations in Hong Kong to curb such behaviours, he added. \n He said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in Hong Kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks.  \n “At the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there’s simply not enough,” he said. “Hong Kong doesn’t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.”     Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, told TODAY that the city folks started hoarding long before Singaporeans did. He said it all started with the shortage of disposable masks. Photo: Reuters \n While the panic-buying in Hong Kong mirrors what happened in Singapore, the similarity ends there. \n For one, there is no risk of Singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the Covid-19 outbreak, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli. \n The country has managed to be resilient due to astute planning by the nation’s food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on Feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 Singapore Food Story. The food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area.  \n On the evening of the panic buying in Singapore, Mr Seah Kian Peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative NTUC Fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the warehouse.  \n However, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside when panic sets in. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said a spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people’s brai\nns tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the SPS spokesperson. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.  \n The spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.  \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n This phenomenon of groupthink results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes.  \n “In this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,” said the spokesperson.  \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n The images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan.   “This meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,” she said. “Which is: The shelves are empty. Better start to go now.”    \n  Shoppers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza reaching out for toilet paper even before it got stocked in the shelves. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Professor Straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch’s observation about social media, Prof Straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n The SPS council spokesperson noted that when the Covid-19 virus was first made known, there was an overwhelming amount of news and social media coverage. \n “When the Dorscon Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying ‘the coronavirus has arrived’, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,” the spokesperson said.  \n Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused.   \n She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences.   \n Such messages, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats.   \n “In this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,” said Prof Lwin. \n In other words, some segments of the population “may undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threat”, said the health communications expert. For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted.  \n That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying. Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. “We all want to do something to make our\nselves feel better,” she quipped. \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.  \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun, who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes.\" \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some experts felt that Prime Minister Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy. \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch of PRecious Communications said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n THE RAMIFICATIONS  \n Mr Chan, the Trade and Industry Minister, had spoken out against panic buying and hoarding behaviour by a “small segment of Singaporeans”, even though he noted that this was to be expected.  \n In a Facebook post on Feb 8, he noted that it was “natural” in times of uncertainty that people want to protect themselves and the ones that they love.  \n “However I urge all of us to think\nof the larger communities we belong to. Hoarding means that we deprive others of things that they really need,” he said. “That could be your neighbour who needs to buy rice for her children’s meals or even organisations looking after the vulnerable who require cleaning supplies.” \n Speaking to the media the next day, Mr Chan also said that the panic buying at supermarkets will signal to other countries that Singaporeans cannot react well in times of crisis and could be taken advantage of in the future. \n One potential consequence, he warned, is that suppliers and retailers who observe the panic buying might take advantage of the situation and jack up prices of goods. \n Ultimately, the hoarding behaviour was “a fight-or-flight response that has arisen primarily from fear and a need for self-preservation”, said the SPS council spokesperson. \n And this fear can breed distrust and hostility towards others. “With a constant overemphasis on fear, people may start to behave in less caring or more complacent ways in order to maintain self-preservation,” the spokesperson added.   \n HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n  \n (From left) Sisters Ruirui and Rui'en delivering breakfast to a healthcare worker on Feb 8, 2020. Photo: Tong Yee/ Facebook \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods take a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.  “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n  \n Messages from the public thanking healthcare workers for their hard work. These messages were put up on Facebook with the hashtag #braveheartsg, in response to the initiative by community group StandUpForSG. Photo: Facebook/Muru Nagaraju, Jocelyn Chng, JJ Huang, Dawn Yip \n A taxi driver, who wanted to be known as Mr Ahmad, said he is not scared and has no qualms about picking up healthcare workers.   \n Although his wife worries for him, as there is no way of knowing whether a passenger might be infected with the virus, the 56-year-old CityCab driver said he still has to continue driving to support his family.   \n The virus outbreak, he added, had drastically affected his earnings lately, though he declined to reveal by how much. \n “So far, even my friends (who are also taxi drivers) have all been contin\nuing to work as per normal,” said Mr Ahmad.  \n The only difference is that he has taken some precautions, such as winding down the windows to air his vehicle after dropping off each passenger and disinfecting his steering wheel with Dettol, he added.  \n For 37-year-old father Lucas Chiam, he sought to turn the situation around by using it as an opportunity to spend more time with his two sons, aged six and four. \n Due to Covid-19, the lecturer and his wife decided to limit their children’s outings to the parks and playgrounds, where they would typically just keep an eye out for the youngsters’ safety. \n Instead, they introduced the boys to home-based activities which could involve the entire family, such as arts and craft, reading and even playing Xbox console games.  \n “I think the best we can do right now is to stay positive. This is an opportunity to bond with the kids, work on some home improvement tasks and plan for the year ahead,” Mr Chiam said.  \n “Maybe through these tough times, we can develop some new good habits for the family that will stay with us even after the threat is over.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Meanwhile, curtain maker and supplier MC2 held its first Facebook Live event on Feb 11. \n Mr Wilson Chew, the founder and managing director of the company, said: “During this time of crisis when people may be worried about attending events with crowds, we thought of using Facebook Live.” \n By broadcasting live on the social media platform, customers were given the chance to ask questions and interact with the company’s salesperson in real time as he gave demonstrations of the company’s various zip-blind products.  \n Business owners like Ms Chong and Mr Chew are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy.   But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.”     \n   \n  \n"}, {"content": "Scientists believe they have discovered the origin of the deadly virus that has already spread throughout the world.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said.

Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters.

However, it comes right before the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays, raising the risk that it could spread further.\n“There was a sharp fall in Hong Kong stock futures that rippled through the currency market and pushed up the yen,” said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“I can understand why some people would say the Chinese virus is the trigger, but it is still too early to be certain.”\nThe yen edged higher 0.15% to 110.01 per dollar on Tuesday.\nIn the onshore market, the yuan fell to 6.8916 per dollar, the lowest level in almost a week. In the offshore market, it dropped to 6.8886.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.598, near the highest level in a month.\nTraders in Japan were also focused on a Bank of Japan meeting.\nAt the two-day rate review that ends on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero.\nThe BOJ is also expected to nudge up its growth forecasts as improved macroeconomic indicators take some pressure off the central bank for more stimulus, but traders will scrutinise governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s remarks after the policy decision.\nElsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.18% to $0.6862 as worries about the Chinese virus hurt currencies sensitive to risk. The New Zealand dollar also eased 0.11% to $0.6604.\nThe euro was locked in a narrow range before a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday where it is expected to launch a comprehensive review of central bank strategy, including the ECB’s inflation target.\nAgainst the dollar, the euro traded at $1.1096. The common currency was also quoted at 85.34 pence.\nThe ECB’s first meeting of the year is most likely to launch a rethink of an inflation goal the bank has failed to meet since 2013.\nThe scope and scale of the review will be a key focus for markets given the far-reaching implications for monetary policy.\nA slightly brighter tone to data means the ECB’s assessment of the economic outlook will also be watched closely by investors on Thursday.

In addition, they can also be better monitored by health services. (the incubation period of the disease until the first symptoms appear) and \"active surveillance\" will be carried out by healthcare professionals twice a day.\nAt a time when an epidemiological inquiry was still ongoing into those repatriated by an International Sanity Team at Figo Maduro Airport, where they landed on board the C-130 of the Air Force picking them up in Marseille, the Minister explained that if any doubt were raised during this process, they would be made clear by the Telephone contact veils from the helpline to the doctor of the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) \"Your possible medical validation will determine that the case is sent in accordance with the transport protocol to one of the reference hospitals\", he said.\nNew tests\nAfter tests have been carried out on the way out of China, which have proved negative, the 20s will be tested again here.

China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, while the city of Wuhan, the pandemic's ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work.\nIt was the fourth day in a row with an increase in Chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas.\nBut in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media CCTV News reported on Sunday. It cited the city's epidemic prevention and control command center.\nNon-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an RNA test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said.\nDespite the relaxed measures for Wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days - China is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly Chinese people returning from overseas. That has led Beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally.\nIn a sign of how seriously China is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in Beijing starting Monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.\nInternational flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. Passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to Beijing, the regulator said.\nSeparately, Shanghai and Guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an RNA test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a program that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries.\nAmong the new cases from abroad reported on Sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.\nThe new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, called for all cities in China to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad.\nHe also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau as well, he said on his Weibo account on Sunday.\n\"I am worried that there are similar cases to the Guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country. There were reports previously that people coming back from abroad returned to their homes in Shanghai without any obstacles,\" Hu said.\n\"It matters to the overall situation of China's next prevention and control efforts if we can plug the leaks.\"\nThe Global Times is a tabloid published by the Ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.\nThe latest figures from China's National Health Commission bring total reported coronavirus cases in the country to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on Saturday. On Saturday, China reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported.\nOf all 97 imported cases as of end-Saturday, 92 of them are Chinese nationals and 51 are Chinese students returning from studying abroad, said Gao Xiaojun, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission during a press conference on Sunday.\nThe Beijing health commission announced separately on its website it had two more imported cases on Sunday, bringing the city's total number of imported cases to 99 as of Sunday noon.\nBACK TO A KIND OF NORMAL\nChina is trying to revive an economy that is widely expected to contract deeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public.\nStill, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity.\nOn Sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. He said China's recent policy measures were gaining tractio\nn, and it has capacity for further action.\nChen Yulu, a deputy governor at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), also said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nAnd while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing.\nGlobally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.\n\"Now I think the epidemic has been controlled. But this definitely doesn't mean that it's over,\" said a 25-year-old woman surnamed He who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast Summer Palace complex in Beijing on Saturday.\n\"I'm willing to come out today but of course I am still afraid,\" she told Reuters.\nThe central province of Hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital Wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases.\nChina has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down Hubei province.\n"}, {"content": "Hospitals are not well prepared, according to the Federal Medical Board. The Federal Medical Chamber does not consider the hospitals in Germany sufficiently prepared for the new Coronavirus. Ideally for patients with this virus are single rooms with prefilled rooms, but there are not many more of them, said Pandemic Envoy of the Chamber, Susanne Johna, the New Osnabruck Newspaper. The number of these rooms has been reduced for cost reasons over the past decade.\nJohna said that in case of urgent treatment, so-called single boxes would be needed in intensive care to minimise the risk of transmission. There are also too few for cost reasons.\nThe hygiene expert, who is also chairman of the Marburger Bund, described the new virus from China as a wake-up call. It's not just hospital equipment that needs catching up. Public health services are also \"massively understaffed\" in many places. There is a shortage of doctors and specialists.\nBut John warned of panic. It is true that the new virus must be taken seriously, because we do not yet know everything about it. But there is no current threat. The risk of a normal flu was much higher. Some 40 people died of influenza in Germany this winter. But the flu is known \"and is therefore not taken as seriously as a new pathogen with many unknowns\".\nIn Germany, a fifth case of infection with the new virus was confirmed on Thursday evening. As in the other four German cases, it is an employee of the automotive supplier Webasto based in Upper Bavaria, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less\nThe WHO recommends that general hygiene rules be observed: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) stressed that Germany was well prepared for the virus. In an interview with Focus magazine, he said the federal government had taken steps to identify suspicious cases early and thus minimise the risk of infection. Spahn said that he did not consider the new respiratory disease to be an emergency in Germany: \"We are very vigilant. But we are relaxed.\"\nIn China, infections and deaths caused by the Coronavirus continued to increase. The number of patients increased by 1.981 to now 9.692, as reported by the Beijing Health Commission. The number of deaths increased by 42 to 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) had previously declared the spread of the virus to be an \"international health emergency\" and the 190-member countries will thus coordinate among themselves the crisis measures recommended by the WHO.\nBecause of the virus, the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert for all of China. The Foreign Office in Berlin initially warned against travelling to the most affected province of Hubei, but in a partial travel warning, recommended postponing \"if possible\" unnecessary trips to China.\n"}, {"content": "Second plane of evacuees from China lands in France. “There are many Europeans, 29 different nationalities, 30 with French nationality,” said Jean-Yves le Drian, France's minister of foreign affairs.\n“We have assumed our responsibility in the sharing and solidarity with Europeans.

But as the virus spread, the\ngovernment clamped down on everything and the city became a ghost town,” she\nsaid.\nOvernight the Chinese capital, like other cities across the\ncountry, became deserted after imposing restrictions and shut down public\nspaces.\nAlthough Beijing is not under a strict government-ordered\nlockdown, like in Wuhan — which is the “epicentre” of the virus outbreak — it\nhas, however, imposed restrictions on every aspect of life since declaring the\nhighest level of public health emergency on January 24.\nThis shutdown across most of China has caused the country\nand, to an extent, its economy to grind to a halt.\n“We were fine for about a week after the restrictions were\nimposed and then we started seeing the impact of it. We were not allowed out of\nour apartments. In any case we did not want to leave for fear of becoming\ninfected.\n“Each person entering or leaving the apartment had to\nprovide details of where they were going to and who they have been in contact\nwith. Most of the businesses, schools, shops and everything else is closed.\n“Water was the first commodity to run out as stocks are not\nbeing replenished and then it was food items,” said Mriska.\nFor the Chinese, the December and January period is heralded\nas the Spring Festival and many use that time to splurge on travel and\nvacations.\nMischa, who lives and teaches in Yanjaio in the Hebei\nprovince, just outside Beijing, was at Disneyland in Shanghai and woke up to\novernight news that the city was on lockdown as a result of the virus.\n“I just packed my bags and headed for the airport. I didn’t\nwant to be stranded in a hotel in Shanghai. The airport was an absolute mess\nbut I eventually managed to get a flight to Beijing, where I spent a few days\nwith my sister before heading back,” said Mischa.\nBut that was nothing compared to what she would find when\nshe returned to Yanjaio and then tried to leave there again.\n“When I got back, it was already a ghost town. There was not\na soul to be seen. We couldn’t even get masks. Because it is a smaller village,\npeople were very scared. Soon there was no food and water,” said Mischa.\nAt the same time, the sisters were arranging to return to South\nAfrica.\n“We couldn’t go to work as everything was shut down and we\nwere also growing scared that if we delayed we would not be able to leave as\nmost airlines were clamping down on their flights out of China,” said Mriska.\nWhen they eventually made their arrangements, it was another\nbattle to get Mischa from Yanjaio to Beijing.\n“The subways were not running and neither were there any\ntaxis available as people were not taking chances and coming out of their\nhomes. I had to call a Chinese friend, who knew another person who drove a\ntaxi, and after three attempts got a taxi to come to Beijing. I just had to try\nanyway I could to get to Beijing to my sister so we could fly out,” said\nMischa.\n“I eventually managed to get a taxi but the journey to\nBeijing was long and difficult. It’s normally a 45-minute trip for the 36 km,\nbut the border posts were busy and the authorities had to stop each car and\ncheck on each person.\n“Every person had to have their temperatures checked and\nsign forms indicating where they were from and where they were going to.”\nAt the same time, as news of the deaths from the virus\nspread, fear-mongering grew. “My Chinese friend returned from vacation to find\nshe had nowhere to live. Her flatmates had changed the password on the access\nsystem and locked her out as she had been travelling and they were not prepared\nto take the risk,” said Mriska.\nEventually leaving China on February 3, the sisters flew to\nDubai and then arrived in South Africa on February 7.\n“We booked our flights and kept monitoring to see that it\nwasn’t cancelled as most airlines we\nre cancelling their flights. We were lucky.\n“We arrived at the airport six hours ahead of our flight to\nmake sure everything would run smoothly only to find horrendous queues and\nthousands of people from all over the world also trying to get out of China\nwhile they could.\n“Everyone was wearing masks, and even on the flights we had\nto keep it on,” said Mischa.\nLanding with masks on in Dubai, she said, was pretty\nawkward, as other travellers distanced themselves from them and gave them\nstrange looks because it was evident they were from China because of the masks.\n“At Dubai and in South Africa, upon landing we were\nsubjected to temperature checks and had to fill in forms advising where we had\nbeen travelling from and if we were ill,” said Mischa.\nGlad that they are back home, the sisters said they were thankful\nto be away from the outbreak.\n“We have work commitments and will have to go back once all\nof this is over. But we are just glad to be home, to have drinking water and\nfood, fresh air and be safe,” said Mriska.\nTheir parents, Kamal and Jasmin Singh, were due to fly to\nChina on February 7 to visit their daughters but had to cancel their trip as\nwell.\n“We were stressed out and encouraged the girls to come home.\nWe are just glad that they got here in time and that they are safe,” said\nJasmin.\n‘Suffering and sadness around’\nVeteran KZN journalist Martin Challenor, who lives in\nYinzhou District, Ningbo, with his wife Kathy, said on Facebook that they\nventured out of their apartment on their ebikes only to buy food.\nHe said all non-essential businesses, bars, restaurants and\nsome malls had closed.\n“The medical authorities keep us updated on the virus\nthrough WeChat. The day starts in a macabre way — checking the statistics about\nthe virus. There are as of now [Tuesday] 1 017 deaths and 42 714 confirmed\ncases.\n“The statistics are updated far too often for my liking.\nThere are cellphone apps that tell me there were 13 cases in my suburb, the\nclosest being 707 metres away from me right now.\n“I do not like being confined to my flat. One person can go\nout to shop every second day. People returning to China and their homes from\nother cities are subjected to 14 days quarantine. These measures are needed\nbecause the virus spreads so easily and because a person can spread the virus\nfor 14 days after catching it and before falling ill themselves. I am growing\nweaker through inactivity. There is so much suffering and sadness around me,”\nreads his post.\nRecommended safety measures\nAlthough there are no reported cases of the coronavirus in\nSouth Africa, practising recommended measures advised by the World Health\nOrganisation will help in the long-term.\n• Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an\nalcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty.\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using\nalcohol-based hand rub eliminates the virus if it is on your hands.\n• Practice respiratory hygiene\nWhen coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed\nelbow or tissue — discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your\nhands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\nWhy? Covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing\nprevent the spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough into your\nhands, you may contaminate objects or people that you touch.\n• Maintain social distancing\nMaintain at least a one-metre distance between yourself and\nother people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.\nWhy? When someone who is infected with a respiratory disease\nlike 2019-nCoV coughs or sneezes, they project small droplets containing the\nvirus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the virus.\n• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated\nwith the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated\nhands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.\n• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek\nmedical care early\nTell your health care provider if you have travelled in an\narea in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close\ncontact with someone who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms.\nWhy? Whenever you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing\nit is important to seek medical attention promptly as this may be due to a\nrespiratory infection or other serious condition. Respiratory symptoms with\nfever can have a range of causes, and depending\non your personal travel history\nand circumstances, 2019-nCoV could be one of them.\n• If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel\nhistory to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand\nhygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible.\n• As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures\nwhen visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets.\nEnsure regular hand washing with soap and potable water\nafter touching animals and animal products; avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth\nwith hands; and avoid contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products.\nStrictly avoid any contact with other animals in the market (e.g., stray cats\nand dogs, rodents, birds, bats).\nAvoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or\nfluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.\n• Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products\nHandle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care, to avoid\ncross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.\n— World Health Organisation.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Delhi govt sets up isolation wards in 25 hospitals, schools send advisories to parents.

BEIJING, Jan 30 -- The seafood market in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, may not be the only source of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, Xinhua news agency reported a Chinese pulmonary disease specialist as saying.Huang Chaolin, vice director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, revealed in a recent interview with business magazine Caixin that there might be multiple places where the virus was first transmitted to humans.Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is one of the city's designated hospitals to admit patients infected with the new virus. Huang and his team have recently published a paper in the Lancet, the world's leading general medical journal, about some early findings on the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases.The first patient, who was admitted to Huang's hospital on Dec 1, 2019, had no direct exposure to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was previously considered as the source of the epidemic, and his family had no fever or respiratory symptoms, according to the paper.Among the following three patients who were admitted on Dec. 10, two had no exposure to the seafood market. In total, only 27 of the 41 cases had exposure to the marketplace, said the paper.\"Judging from the whole situation, the seafood market may not be the only source.

(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: ICE Newcastle coal vs. SGX Indonesia coal: reut.rs/3bmYOzG\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 26 (Reuters) - Asia’s seaborne coal market is increasingly diverging between higher-quality Australian coal, where prices are holding up despite the economic shock being caused by the coronavirus, and lower-quality Indonesian fuel, which is losing ground.\nThe price of Australian benchmark Newcastle thermal coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ended at $66.35 a tonne on Wednesday, down slightly from the prior day but up from the low so far this year of $65.15 on March 9.\nThe contract, which covers coal with an energy value of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), has traded in a fairly narrow band so far this year, and at the close on Wednesday was only 2% weaker than at the end of last year.\nThis is despite the massive disruption caused to the economy of China, the world’s biggest coal importer, in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus from its origin in the city of Wuhan.\nWhile China has largely contained the virus, it has now spread across the globe, leading to increasingly strong isolation measures in many countries, with the concomitant economic fallout.\nHowever, futures for Indonesian coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kcal/kg traded in Singapore ended at $32.61 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest price this year.\nThe contract is down 10.7% from its peak so far in 2020 of $36.51 a tonne on Feb. 10, and is also 4% softer than its close at the end of last year.\nWhat lies behind the divergence of the two main types of seaborne coal in Asia?\nThe most likely explanation is the current coronavirus crisis is changing market dynamics, rather than any structural change in supply or demand.\nIndonesia’s coal exports have been in a range around 30 million tonnes in recent months, with China and India accounting for about 60% of the total.\nAt the start of the year, both markets were performing well, with China actually importing more coal during its coronavirus lockdown, due to the impact on domestic mines and transport infrastructure.\nIndia’s imports from Indonesia were also resilient in the first two months of the year as coastal power plants increased generation, but they appear to be tapering off this month.\nIn the first 25 days of March just 4.04 million tonnes of Indonesian coal was discharged at Indian ports, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.\nWhile that figure will rise by the end of month as more cargoes are unloaded, it looks certain that March’s total will be below February’s 7.96 million tonnes and January’s 7.42 million.\nIndia has lagged the rest of Asia in being hit by the coronavirus, but the country is now taking strong lockdown measures to prevent its spread, which will curb demand for electricity to power industry.\nCoal stocks at power plants and mines have also been rising, with the Business Standard newspaper reporting on March 24 that inventories were above 100 million tonnes, with stocks at plants reaching a record 41.4 million tonnes.\nPlentiful stocks combined with a sharp slowdown in economic activity mean India’s coal imports are likely to slip in coming months, especially from Indonesia.\nAustralia supplies virtually no thermal coal to India, which generally takes Indonesian coal because of its lower cost and cheaper freight rates. Australia’s trade with India is largely in coking coal used in steel-making.\nThe main markets for Australian thermal coal are China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and Refinitiv data shows these markets have been resilient so far this year.\nTogether these four markets imported 26.8 million tonnes of both thermal and coking coal from Australia in January, the most since July last year, while February’s total was 21.22 million, up from 20.1 million in the same month last year.\nWith the coronavirus outbreak seemingly contained in China and Taiwan, and progress being made in Japan and South Korea, it’s possible that their imports of coal will hold up in coming months, with the main risk being the economic downturn in the rest of the world.\nAssuming no shock to supply should mines be forced to close in Australia to combat the coronavirus, there is a case that prices shouldn’t decline too much, but it would be difficult to make a bullish case until the wor\nld economy is showing signs of recovery.\nWith far greater exposure to India, Indonesian coal prices are more under threat, and will remain so until it’s clear that the world’s second-biggest importer of coal has beaten the coronavirus.

BEIJING: A new virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and reached the United States could mutate and spread, China warned on Wednesday (Jan 22), as authorities urged people to steer clear of the city at the heart of the outbreak. \n The coronavirus has caused alarm due to its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Chinese New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease - including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n  \n In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities cancelled large public events, called on visitors to stay away and urged residents not to leave the central Chinese city of 11 million people. \n The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there \"is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease\", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing. \n The virus has now infected at least 440 people across the country, with most cases in Wuhan. Li added that 1,394 people are still under medical observation. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. \n The first case in the United States - a Seattle resident in his 30s - is in good condition, American officials said. \n The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. \n  \n But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected at least 440 people across the country. \n \"We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,\" Li said, although he said experts believe \"the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan\". \n  \n Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - as the number of cases jumped. \n Plane passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. \n North Korea will ban foreign tourists entirely to protect itself against the virus, according to a major tour operator. \n VIRUS SOURCE \n A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. \n  \n However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. \n A price list circulating online in China for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS. \n \"We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,\" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention. \n He said it was clear \"this virus is adapting and mutating\". \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected. \n CONTAINMENT \n Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital. \n Surgical masks and antibacterial products were starting to sell out on some popular online sites and pharmacies. \n  \n \"These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,\" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school. \n At the capital's main international airport, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Airlines said they agreed to allow staff to wear surgical masks on mainland China flights, adding they would offer masks and antiseptic wipes to passengers travelling from Wuhan to the city. \n In Wuhan, police were conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said. Offic\nials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fevers. \n \"If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,\" Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV. \n The local government has cancelled major public activities and banned tour groups from heading out of the city. \n Women's football qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympic Games that were supposed to be held in Wuhan between Feb 3-9 were moved to the eastern city of Nanjing. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "There are fears, and there is racism. Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this TIME ONLINE series she critically reports on life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym.\nThe Coronavirus epidemic is a test of human accountability. At the Berlin S-Bahnhof Beusselstrasse, a Chinese student was insulted and trampled by two women. In Toronto, an old lady from Hong Kong was insulted in a supermarket. In France, the newspaper Courrier picard titled \"Alerte jaune\" (\"Alarm Yellow\") and \"Le Perril jaune?\" (\"Yellow Danger?\"), and the picture of a Chinese woman in a protective mask was shown (the newspaper has since apologized for her choice of words among readers). The cover design of the recent version of the mirror about the virus \"Made in China\" caused outrage, even though the title story goes in a different direction. People with Chinese roots also experience direct hostilities in Germany. Throughout the world, incidents that target Asian-looking people remind us of an old lesson: fear and ignorance can make people hostile overnight to others who see them as belonging to a particular group, ethnicity, nation.\nDiseases divide us humans. Albert Camus tells about it in The Plague, Jose Saramago in The City of the Blind. This is nothing new; it will certainly happen again in the future, wherever people live. The more one considers himself threatened by a catastrophe, the more fear and stupidity will determine human behavior and lead to violence and cruelty. One can call the resurgence of hostility against Chinese and Chinese racism, but the phenomenon is not confined to the West. In China, people from the outbreak of Wuhan disease are suffering from hostilities in other parts of the country. They are insulted or even physically attacked.\nAs a Chinese woman living in Germany, I am less angered by the expected human inhumanities in the small, I am angered by their profits in the big. Like many other Chinese women in Germany, I have experienced a lot of respect and hospitality here. Right, law and social norms in Germany are so finely aimed at preventing racism that, as soon as I got used to it, I was shocked at how much tolerance there is, on the other hand, in the United States, for example, for the statements of neo-Nazis. I have also experienced racist failures, but never considered them symptomatic. It is for the behavior of people who believe in necessity (or even are) and seek a valve.\nAre we now faced, in times of epidemic, with the risk of a global resurgence of anti-Chinese racism, which many watchful observers are warning of? I'm not sure yet. It is true that it can never be wrong to slow down dangerous social development before it is too late. But when it comes to how to do this most effectively, especially at a time when many societies already seem deeply divided, I may have a different opinion.\nOn the individual level I find anti-racist slogans such as \"Chinese are not a virus!\" or \"Don't be racist!\" little helpful. There are people who are racist to the core. Racists will always find an excuse to attack others. Racists need to be fought. But to scold a Parisian saleswoman for being nervous about Chinese tourists, or a German employee who suddenly doesn't like sitting in the conference room with his Chinese colleague, seems excessive to me. The best way to take away people's fears and avoid such clashes is to provide solid information on potential routes of infection, risks and measures to protect oneself. It is much better to show people that they can do something about the risk of infection than to shame them for their fears.\nOn a political and social level, the situation is different. If the spread of the Coronavirus were to become a truly global pandemic, it could lead to tribalism in the worst form, especially at a time like this,\nin which it can be exploited politically by right-wing populists such as Donald Trump, the Brexit camp, European right-wing radicals. Racism is nothing more than one of the many forms of tribalism. It is possible to cheer it up with irritating headlines, even if the editors of the courier picard or the mirror probably do not want to be on the wrong side.\nThe appeal of nationalism is still strong. Compared to other countries, I have a great deal of domestic vigilance towards nationalist Narratives in Germany. But the fact that they also exist elsewhere, but are used even more successfully politically, must also be made more aware in Germany.\nIn China, the government has long taught people to regard the Communist Party, the country and the people as one. This is an effective way of ensuring the loyalty of all citizens and giving them a false sense of belonging and homeland. That is why many foreign Chinese feel personally attacked when they hear how non-Chinese criticise the Communist Party of China or the government there. They have learned to fully identify with party and state. Unfortunately, many German, German media and even German politics occasionally make the same mistake and confuse the people of China with their government.\nThere are facts about which there is still too little reported in the European media. The new Coronavirus is not \"Made in China\", nor is Ebola \"Made in Africa\". These viruses were not produced on purpose as to how to make products on which to print the designation of origin \"Made in\". But the arrogant and authoritarian system in China has initially allowed the spread of the disease through non-action. Many Chinese, especially in the region around Wuhan, are slowly realising that they have been led into a crisis situation by seeing their eyes: the seriousness of the situation and the dangers have been concealed. Other Chinese women are still holding on to their faith in the supposedly omnipotent government because it is the only stop they know.\nThe crisis in China has many facets. There is a lack of transparency; the Government and the authorities are not in fact liable for their actions or for their non-actions; the public health system is weak; there is no freedom of expression in the country. Many Chinese risk their lives (and their freedom) to defeat the virus and avoid the obstacles that the authoritarian system places in their way. If the world knew and could acknowledge their achievements, there would be no more anti-Chinese tendencies elsewhere.\nBut until people outside China have a clear picture of this, they will only see the outbreak of the Coronavirus as a threatening state of emergency originating in \"China\", a country of which they have only a vague idea. \"China\" is the fault! This vague notion of \"China\" is in itself a form of tribalism, because it is fed by stereotypes and not from the perspective of a country and its inhabitants, the lives and achievements of individuals. Of people who struggle against the arrogance of power over them; seeking and spreading the truth; who are facing a crisis with great courage and intellectual acumen; but who also have to contend with their own human weaknesses: idiocy has no country of origin and origin. But the stories of the brave Chinese must be heard.\nCamus taught us about the plague: \"Evil in the world almost always comes from ignorance, and good will without understanding can do as much harm as evil.\" Camus meant deep understanding, not indefinite half-knowledge. It takes courage to look at the whole truth, because one might find it offensive; because it could offend others; because you may feel uncomfortable with her or other discomfort. The first lesson to be learned from this Coronavirus crisis is that there is a need to distinguish between the Chinese Government and the people of China. If this were to happen, it would be progress.\n"}, {"content": "Pompeo conveyed 'strong U.S. objections' to Beijing over COVID-19 accusations.

HONG KONG — When a virus enters the human body, it's in a race against time to hijack cells, reproduce and spread. Its survival depends on it, because once the body's immune system detects the intruder an all-out microscopic war follows. \n While the Sars-CoV-2 virus behind the present pandemic has killed thousands and spread fear around the world, the immune system — which has evolved over millions of years of fighting pathogens — shows no such trepidation. It responds with ferocity to obliterate the invader, led by armies of killer T-cells. \n That immune system is one reason the human species still exists, but in some cases its fight against viruses can resemble the scorched-earth policy of warfare, where everything in the area of the conflict takes damage, meaning body tissue itself. The immune system takes no prisoners. \n But before the war at the cellular level, the virus slips into the body, navigating past defences in the mucus that gathers in noses and throats, on the hunt for cells it can commandeer. At the same time, it's trying to disguise its presence to avoid tripping the chemical alarm system of the immune system — a deadly game of hide-and-seek. \n In the first few hours after the pathogen's entry, it was \"almost like a dance between the innate immune response and the virus\", said Mr Gene Olinger, an immunologist with the US-based scientific institute MRIGlobal. The virus tries different tricks to dodge the immune system's many detection devices. \n This was the start of what become an \"arms race\" between the virus and immune system, said Ms Marjolein Kikkert, an associate professor who researches this type of biochemical conflict at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. \n \"All viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to prevent these first responses,\" Ms Kikkert said. \n Once the immune system is triggered and a T-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside. \n But as Sars-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. That leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with Sars-CoV-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said. \n Much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). There are also the clinical records of patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2. \n What that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to Mr Stanley Perlman, a professor of immunology at the University of Iowa, whose lab is now replenishing its stock of lab mice genetically engineered for research on immune response to Sars. \n As the body's immune response can be so aggressive, researchers say that the war against the virus can do damage that causes fatal repercussions in the body. \n In particular, Sars-CoV-2 attacks the lungs, an especially sensitive battleground. Also, as the immune system tries to fight a virus that it has never before encountered, it can go into overdrive, causing excessive damage to adjoining cells and tissue. \n The body's early-warning system for invading pathogens was multilayered, Ms Kikkert said. An abnormality inside a cell would typically trigger a \"cascade\" of cell signals. \n She said this led to the production of \"alarm bell\" proteins that warned surrounding cells about the presence of the virus and triggered a flood of immune molecules, creating an \"antiviral state\". \n As more alarms sound throughout the body, the Sars-CoV-2 virus races to propagate and attack more cells. When T-cells arrive to hunt, capture and kill infected cells, the lungs become a battleground, swelling with immune cells, molecules and the fluid that they use to navigate. \n Mr Olinger said that once a T-cell found an infected cell it latched on, \"almost like a Velcro connection\". \"These cells will attach and send molecules that go through that cell and start to kill it,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, antib\nodies, Y-shaped proteins, also arrive and swarm onto the virus, smothering the spikes it uses to attach to healthy cells. Larger white blood cells called macrophages also sweep in, swallowing big clusters of dead virus particles. \n As this cellular carnage spreads, dead cells pile up in the lungs. \n \"They are clogging the airways and reducing the oxygen flow,\" said Ms Ashley St John, an assistant professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore who researches immune pathology. \n \"You need that tissue to be able to stretch and fill with oxygen, but at the same time you are filling it with immune cells and fluid ... it can prevent someone who is trying to breathe from getting enough oxygen,\" she said. \n Some patients who recover from this stage, their lungs can heal. Others may recover, but suffer lasting damage. \n China released data at the end of February that indicates that about 80 per cent of the Sars-CoV-2 infections were mild to moderate, while 14 per cent were severe. The remaining 6 per cent of critical patients may have suffered respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. \n Globally, about 3.4 per cent of infected people might die from a Sars-CoV-2 infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week, although that number may change as disease controls evolve. In China, the fatality rate fell during the course of the outbreak and the increase in infections. \n In interviews, researchers said that the exact way Sars-CoV-2 behaved in the body was still being investigated, but it was clear it took the heaviest toll on the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. \n More than 20 per cent of infected people aged over 80 were likely to die. Death rates for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease are double the average rate, according to statistics from the WHO-China Joint Mission on Covid-19 published at the end of February. \n Some researchers suspect that in the \"hide-and-seek\" period, Sars-CoV-2 compromises the early immune response, either by dividing too rapidly for the system to keep up or disrupting the way the immune system regulates itself. \n There was some evidence this can push a panicked system into overdrive and a \"cytokine storm\" follows that causes tissue inflammation. \n \"With a cytokine storm you have a situation where the brakes aren't working and you have all of these [immune] products [going] out of control ... cells infiltrating into the tissue, breakdown of blood vessels,\" St John said. \n As the body sent out alarms for cells to come to fight the virus, too many or the wrong combination could show up, causing excessive tissue damage, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The lung is the worst place to have that happen. Those cells are there to kill, they are there to encapsulate, and control the infection ... over-response can lead to the damage in the lungs. Cells in that region are not able to transfer oxygen ... it can lead to death of the tissue.\" \n An overwhelming immune response could also lead to death itself, researchers said. \n Getting to the bottom of the \"dance\" between the virus and the immune system's response was something that was hard to do without watching it play out in cells and in animals, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The reality is that until you have the virus in hand you really can't answer a lot of those questions,\" he added. \n \"[This virus] turned science upside down on us, because we know more about the genomic sequence now, whereas in the past other outbreaks that would come way after we had grown the virus and played with it in the laboratory, known how it performs in different cell types.\" \n That is the work now facing researchers like those in Mr Perlman's laboratory as they hope to use mice to get a ringside seat to the fight between Sars-CoV-2 and a mammal immune system. \n Such work needed to be done to work out how to build a Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Mr Perlman said. \n \"How do you make a vaccine that works well if you are not sure what you need to protect a person from infection?\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Brent Oil drops 2% fearing a fall back in demand.

Nine people have died and the number of infections is increasing every day and hour: the latest data show 440 patients. Let me put it bluntly: there were only 41 people last Friday. The Municipal Health Committee promised that there had been no positive physical examination results since January 3. The escalation of this new coronavirus discovered two weeks ago reminds people of SARS, which has similar genes to SARS. The epidemic in 2002 also originated in China, causing 700 deaths worldwide.\nMost of the infected people (270 people) were concentrated in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak in December. The city is located in the center of Chinese territory, with 11 million people living, more than London or New York. Pathogens have begun to spread to neighboring provinces. If there were no positive results last Friday, there are 38 cases in 15 other big cities today.\nBut these data may not be completely reliable. A model developed by experts from the infectious disease epidemiology center of the University of Hong Kong shows that the reality is more worrying than the official data. According to his report prepared in cooperation with the World Health Organization (who) and submitted on Tuesday, the total number of infected people may be close to 1500: 1343 in Wuhan and 115 in China.\nFor a country without freedom of information, doubt is logical. Many people remember the precedent of SARS, when the authorities denied the existence of the virus for weeks. The Communist Party of China also mentioned the incident, warning local and regional governments to accurately report the progress of the incident. \"Anyone who doesn't tell the truth will always be nailed to the pillar of shame,\" Chan An Jian, the official social media profile of the central political and Legal Commission, the CPC's legal supervision body, announced on Monday. This ruling was made after Secretary General Xi Jinping's speech yesterday, in which he called for \"serious treatment\" to curb the epidemic.\nAnother disturbing reason is that the estimation of the University of Hong Kong model reflects a \"mild situation\", that is, Wuhan is still the only outbreak of the epidemic, and there is no highly infectious disease called \"super breeder\".

In addition, it is reported that 14 of them were infected with one patient. Nanshan revealed in an interview with state television yesterday that this opened the door for the existence of these \"super breeders\". \"At present, the key to controlling expansion is to prevent it from happening,\" the researchers pointed out.\nAt the same time, international expansion continues. So far, of the four cases found in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, Taiwan had its first positive case on Tuesday. She is a 55 year old woman. As before, she has also visited Wuhan in recent weeks. \"The patient began to develop symptoms on January 11, but was not hospitalized,\" Huang Wangting, a doctor from Taiwan's central epidemic prevention headquarters, reported this afternoon.

That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.\nChinese authorities say the stabilization in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.\nHowever, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared.\nChina has responded to the COVID-19 virus by effectively locking down Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people.\nThe Communist Party is also struggling to prevent the economy from crashing, as the movement of people and goods around the country and to and from China faces major disruption.\nOn Monday China’s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.\nEven so, economists expect China’s economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody’s on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.\nOutside China, around half of all known cases of the virus have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.\nThe United States was the first country to evacuate its passengers from the ship, flying them out overnight on two chartered aircraft to military bases in Texas and California, where they would be held in quarantine for two weeks.\nThe state department said that after passengers were sent to the airport, officials discovered 14 had tested positive. They were isolated on the flight and permitted to fly home, it said.\nOther countries were expected to follow swiftly, having announced plans to repatriate citizens from the ship. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.\nAuthorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.\nOne American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.\nCarnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.\n“Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,” a statement from the company’s Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.\n“We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,” said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. “We have no idea when we get to get home.”\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.\nSome cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.\nIn Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.\nTrade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recessi\non is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.\nOrganizers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.\nJapan’s Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito’s public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year.

MANADO, Indonesia (Reuters) - Bat meat is still popular in some parts of Indonesia, despite research suggesting the coronavirus spreading from China might have originated in bats before being passed on to humans.\nBats are traditionally eaten by the Minahasan people from North Sulawesi in the form of a curry-like dish called Paniki. Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.\n“It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,” said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.\n“In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.”\nOn an average day, Timbuleng sells 50-60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.\n“Bats are the favourite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,” Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.\n“My favourite part is the wings,” Wongso added.\nGlands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.\nIt is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat’s hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.\nThe coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species,\nIn China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.\nThere are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.\nNone has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.\nFor Manadonese Jufry Mantak, the links between the coronavirus and his favourite dish have not put him off.\n“We have not found any (coronavirus) cases in Manado. Up till now, there are still many people eating these bats. Because bats are good, especially when cooked with coconut milk.”\n"}, {"content": "iran virus deaths now 77 as emergency services chief infected.

To prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus, scientists and researchers have constantly emphasised that washing hands with soap at frequent intervals is necessary. But do you know the number of times a doctor has to wash hands after treating patients infected with the Covid-19 disease, which is caused by the virus?\nA video shared on Twitter by China Global Television Network will answer this question. To begin with, doctors, who treat coronavirus patients, wear protective suits and multiple gloves. In the video, a doctor washes her hands firstly and then, takes off her shoe covers. She washes her hands again and takes off the first layer of gloves, and then, does the most obvious. Wash her hands.\nAfter unzipping her medical gown, she again, washes her hands. She, soon after, takes off the hat of her medical gown and rigorously washes her hands. Well, in this manner, she washes her hands after every step of taking off her medical suit.

BEIJING (AFP) - As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people. \n From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it \"basically curbed\", here is a look at how China grappled with Covid-19: \n The first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on Dec 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with fever. \n On Dec 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organisation. \n But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was \"preventable and controllable\". \n A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" about the then mysterious disease. \n There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm. \n The number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on Jan 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts. \n China announced the existence of a \"new type of coronavirus\" on Jan 9 and the first death two days later. \n But between Jan 5 and Jan 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections. \n During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak. \n Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Dr Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistle-blowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Dr Li. \n An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on Jan 18. \n The same day, Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate. \n On Jan 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comment on the issue. \n Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day. \n This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide. \n Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on Jan 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days. \n Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media. \n The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday before travel curbs were imposed. \n On Jan 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a \"global emergency\". \n Between Feb 1 and Feb 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636. \n On Feb 7 the Wuhan medical whistle-blower Dr Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. \n Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media. \n Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet - including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei. \n The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on Feb 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China's data. \n Mr Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight. \n But on Feb 15, Beijing released a speech by Mr Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as Jan 7 - well before the authorities announced human-to-human transmission - in an attempt to boost the leader's public image. \n In late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea. \n On Tuesday (March 10), Mr Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control. \n Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from Feb 11 as \"critical\" in curbing the spread in the city,\nalthough some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households. \n After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope.\n"}, {"content": "Stunned world grapples with 'once-in-100-year' coronavirus battle.

Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. \n However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. \n Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. \n During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. \n Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. \n In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders\". \n \"The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. \n Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan 20, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" \n National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. \n Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\". But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \n \"In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorised,\" he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. \n DELAYED RESPONSE \n China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. \n The country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. \n Once a virus has been identified, \"You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic\npreparedness. \n  \n Although information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said. \n John Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \n \"We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,\" he told Reuters. \"Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\" \n The shortage of testing supplies and China's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \n \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. \n City managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for Chinese New Year and sessions of the province's National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. \n STILL WAITING \n Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. \n But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. \n To qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away\", an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters. \n  \n Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. \n Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters. \n \"Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told Reuters. \"The actual deaths were higher.\" \n Reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. \n Zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. \n However, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. \n None of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment. \n Sixty-nine-year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had run out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. \n He was finally admitted on Jan 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicised his case on Weibo. \n Researchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1 per cent of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities. \n \"All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan 14 and was still untested on Monday. \"At least if it's confirmed we have a direction. If there\n's no direction, there's no hope.\" \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "u.s. ramps up anti-coronavirus measures at border as impact spreads. SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON - The United States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.  \n That measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.  \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.  \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.  \n The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.  \n \"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.  \n As of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.  \n \"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.  \n The move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning.  \n \"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"  \n Other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.  \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.  \n Many airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.  \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.  \n The United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.  \n The virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.  \n  \n GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS  \n With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]  \n The outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.  \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.  \n Home appliance maker Electrolux <ELUXb.ST> issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co <DE.N> said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.  \n WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.  \n \"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"  \n  \n VIRUS EPICENTRE  \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wu\nhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.  \n China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.  \n Like other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.  \n \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.  \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.  \n Graphic - Tracking China’s novel coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html  \n Graphic - The Coronavirus Outbreak: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH/0100B59Y39P/index.html REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "Scientists identify two types of Covid-19 virus. SHANGHAI • Scientists in China studying the coronavirus outbreak said they had found two main types of the virus could be causing infections. \n The researchers, from Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their analysis examined a limited range of data and said follow-up studies of larger data sets are needed to better understand the virus' evolution. \n The preliminary study found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus associated with the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70 per cent of analysed strains, while 30 per cent was linked to a less aggressive type. \n They said the prevalence of the more aggressive virus decreased after early January. \"These findings strongly support an urgent need for further, immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with Covid-19.\" \n Their findings were published on Tuesday in the National Science Review, the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \n One of China's top medical associations yesterday confirmed that the median incubation period of the virus is five to seven days and the maximum 14 days. The remarks by Mr Du Bin, chairman of the critical care medical branch of the Chinese Medical Association, are the most conclusive assessment of the virus' incubation period by a government-affiliated medical body. \n The revelations came amid a fall in new cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second-largest economy to stop its spread. \n China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of last month. \n The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270.

SINGAPORE — Three more people here have been diagnosed as being infected by the Covid-19 coronavirus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday (Feb 19), while five people were discharged from hospital. \n Of the three new patients, one was admitted at first for dengue fever in the general ward of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. After she was found to have the Covid-19 virus, those who shared the ward with her had to be transferred to single wards and tested for infection as a precautionary measure, while contact tracing is ongoing for hospital workers who attended to her. \n It is unclear if she had both dengue and Covid-19 viruses. MOH said that contact tracing is underway for this patient to establish any links to previous cases or to recent travel to China. \n For the other two newly diagnosed patients, one is linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore cluster and another is linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster.  \n So far, 84 people in Singapore have been sickened by the virus. A total of 34 people have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital. For the 50 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Four are in critical condition under intensive care, MOH said. \n With the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, links between a vast majority of locally transmitted cases have been established — they had travel history to China or were connected to existing clusters or other cases.  \n The five people discharged on Wednesday were: \n The first confirmed patient, a 66 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20 and stayed at the Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa in Sentosa \n A 42-year-old Singaporean woman who was a teacher at Victoria Junior College (Case 32) \n A 39-year-old Singaporean woman who went to the Life Church and Missions Singapore (Case 33) \n A 37-year-old Singaporean man from Certis Cisco who served quarantine orders on a Wuhan couple (case 44) \n A 30-year-old Singaporean man who went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King (Case 55)  \n  \n NEW CONFIRMED CASES \n Case 82 \n Case 82 is a 57-year-old Singaporean woman who did not go to China recently. She is warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH). \n She reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at Jurong Polyclinic on Feb 10, as well as a general practitioner (GP) clinic on Feb 12. She went to the emergency department at NTFGH on Feb 13 and 15, and was admitted as a dengue patient in a general ward on Feb 15. \n Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on the afternoon of Feb 18, and she was immediately transferred to an isolation room. \n As a precautionary measure, the patients who shared the room with her while she was in the general ward have been transferred to single rooms. They have been tested for Covid-19 infection and the results are pending. So far, none of them has any respiratory symptoms. \n Contact tracing of NTFGH staff members who had been in contact with the patient is underway. The room has also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, MOH said. \n Before she was admitted, the woman had mostly stayed at home in the Jurong West Street 41 area, except when she had to seek medical treatment. \n Case 83 \n Case 83 is a 54-year-old Singaporean man who had not been to China lately, but he travels frequently to Malaysia for work purposes. He was confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on the morning of Feb 19, and is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n He is linked to the cluster from The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. \n Case 84 \n Case 84 is a 35-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She tested positive for the virus on the morning of Feb 19, and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. She is linked to Case 66, a 28 year-old Singaporean man who works at Grace Assembly of God church and attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church on Jalan Peminpin in Marymount. \n UPDATE ON PREVIOUS CASE \n Case 80 is a 38-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She is warded in an isolation room at the National University Hospital (NUH) and is linked to Case 66, who is part of the Grace Assembly of God cluster. \n She reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 4 and had sought treatment at a GP clinic on Feb 4 and 10. Sh\ne was referred to NUH for a chest X-ray on Feb 11, and went back to NUH again on Feb 17. Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on the morning of Feb 18. \n Before she was hospitalised, she had gone to work at NUH where she does administrative tasks and had not interacted with patients since the onset of symptoms. She lives along Fernvale Link in Sengkang. \n LINKS TO PREVIOUS CASES \n Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, MOH said. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force. \n Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). \n Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road), a health product shop off Lavender Street. \n Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at the Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January. \n Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n In total, 22 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God. \n Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, MOH  said its investigations have identified the following links between cases: \n Case 44, a 37-year-old Singaporean man who works at Certis Cisco Centre and had served Quarantine Orders on two people from Wuhan, was linked to Cases 13 and 26, a mother-and-daughter pair from Wuhan; \n Case 72, a 40 year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder and has no recent travel history to China, is a non-medical contact of Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here; \n Case 75, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 41, a 71-year-old Singaporean man who visited Paya Lebar Methodist Church and a gathering at Braddell Heights Residents’ Committee;  \n Case 77 is linked to Case 50, who in turn is linked to Case 65 and Case 55, a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at Pulau Bukom and went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King. \n As of noon on Wednesday, MOH has identified 2,593 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 1,172 are still under quarantine, while 1,421 have completed their quarantine.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus will have been transmitted to humans by wild animals infected with bats.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country’s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China’s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n“We are doing much better now... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,” he told reporters.\nLi Bin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that since 2003, China had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats.\n“With relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since SARS ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,” he said.\nA key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population.\nLi said Beijing had learned from its experiences with SARS and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n“The speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,” said Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating SARS.\nExperts say the failures of SARS were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n“China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China’s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several “back-up” hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China’s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency. Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times said on Wednesday that “concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic”.\nPresident Xi Jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions people travel.\nNevertheless, some people said Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online.\nSocial media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of China\n’s data.\n“We can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,” said MacIntyre.\nAnd the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus.\nAdam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said China has “come a long way” since the outbreak of SARS.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” he said.\n"}, {"content": "World shuts down Chinese travelers for fear of coronavirus.

SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported one new case of Covid-19 infection in Singapore on Friday (Feb 21), a Singaporean man who is linked to the first known patient with both dengue and Covid-19. \n Ten patients were discharged on Friday, bringing the total number of people who have recovered from the infection to 47, MOH said. \n A total of 39 people are still in hospital while five are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. \n The latest case, which MOH referred to as Case 86, is a 24-year-old Singapore Institute of Technology student who has not recently travelled to China. \n He is warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH). \n MOH said that the man reported an onset of symptoms on Feb 14 and sought treatment at two general practitioner (GP) clinics on Feb 16 and 18. \n On Feb 19, he went to NTFGH and was immediately isolated. \n He was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection in the afternoon on Feb 20. \n The man lives in the Bukit Batok East Avenue 5 area. He has not gone to school since the onset of symptoms. \n  \n CASE 85 \n MOH also gave more details on Case 85, the patient announced on Thursday. \n The 36-year-old male Chinese national reported an onset of symptoms on Feb 14 and sought treatment at a GP clinic on the day and on Feb 16. On Feb 19, he went to the GP again and then to Yishun Polyclinic to seek treatment, before he was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in an ambulance. He was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Feb 20. \n Before he was warded, he had mostly stayed at his rental apartment on Woodlands Avenue 6, except to seek medical treatment, MOH said. \n LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES \n Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, MOH said. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force. \n Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). \n Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road), a health product shop off Lavender Street. \n Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at the Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22. \n Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n In total, 22 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God. \n Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, MOH said that its investigations have identified the following links between cases: \n Case 44, a 37-year-old Singaporean man who works at Certis Cisco Centre and had served Quarantine Orders on two people from Wuhan, was linked to Cases 13 and 26, a mother-and-daughter pair from Wuhan; \n Case 72, a 40-year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder and has no recent travel history to China, is a family member of Case 79, a Malaysian work pass holder, and is also linked to Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here; \n Case 75, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 41, a 71-year-old Singaporean man who visited Paya Lebar Methodist Church and a gathering at Braddell Heights Residents’ Committee; \n Case 77 is linked to Case 50, who in turn is linked to Case 65 and Case 55, a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at Pulau Bukom and went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King.\n"}, {"content": "China reproaches West's 'laxity' in fight against coronavirus. “Here in Milan, the area hardest hit by Covid-19, the lockdown measures are very lax,” said Chinese Red Cross vice president Sun Shuopeng, who visited the northern Italian city with a team of specialists flown in from China.\nItaly, with 3,405 coronavirus deaths, is the country with the most casualties, overtaking China with 3,248 casualties.\nIn spite of a draconian lockdown, Italy’s numbers have continued to soar over the past week, reaching 41,035 cases yesterday, compared to China, where infections seem to have stabilised at 81,000.\nUnlike China, Italy does not seem able to implement the strict lockdown.\n“I can see public transport is still running, people are still moving around, having gatherings in hotels, and they are not wearing masks,” said Sun, warning that public resistance to the lockdown will prove deadly.\n“I don’t know what people here are thinking. We really have to stop our usual economic activities and our usual human interactions. We have to stay at home and make every effort to save lives. It is worth putting every cost we have into saving lives,” he was quoted as saying.\nDictatorship\nChina, which is ruled by an authoritarian communist dictatorship, is extremely well positioned to mobilise large numbers of people.\nSince the Communist takeover in 1949, “mass mobilisation” has been a trusted tool of the Chinese Communist Party in organising millions of people to work for a common goal.\nBefore the 1978 capitalist revolution, Beijing's “mass mobilisation” resulted in disasters like the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution.\nBut the principles – the central leadership issues a decree, which is then transmitted to the grassroots and implemented by local police, party cells and thousands of neighborhood committees – have remained the same ever since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping started his capitalist reforms.\nIn today’s China, foreigners are often flabbergasted to see the short time it takes for the authorities to empty entire cities, as happens yearly during party celebrations.\nIn 2003, all cities and most villages in China’s countryside were locked down as a result of the Sars-1 epidemic. The policy is implemented swiftly and without much consideration or discussion, and, as recorded by human rights organisations, accompanied by ruthless censorship, police brutality and unnecessary suffering of many people. Critics of the Beijing regime claim dissidents and other “hostile elements” are also rounded up in the process.\nHerd mentality\nIn spite of criticism of its draconian measures, China now prides itself on having successfully contained the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, there has been widespread shock about plans by some European countries to counter the epidemic by using so-called “herd immunity,” where large segments of the population are exposed to the virus to be cured by the natural autodefence system of individuals.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, in his speech on 15 March, said that “the virus will be among us for a long time to come … a large part of the population will be infected.”\nWhile the Netherlands' health authorities advised precautions such as washing hands, keeping a safe social distance and reporting to a medical service if showing symptoms, they did not impose a hard lockdown.\nProtective wall\nThe more people who get infected, Rutte argues, the more people will achieve immunity, resulting in “a protective wall”.\nThe policy the Dutch government has chosen is one of “controlled spreading” of the disease, and only among those who are not in risk groups, such as the elderly or chronically ill. These groups will be completely isolated.\nThe alternative, proposed and implemented by China, and now in force in Italy and France, is “complete lockdown,” minimising contact between people.\nRutte rejected this saying it would “lock down the country for at least a year” without a guaranteed success.\nRutte was echoing the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who told the local media that the British would aim to achieve “herd immunity”, claiming that once 60 percent of the population (40 million people) contract the coronavirus, the resulting pool of natural immunity will limit the impact of the infection.\nThe remarks caused a tsunami of anger and ridicule on Chinese social platforms.\nSocial Darwinism\nCritics said the UK and other proponents of the ‘’herd immuninty” theory were promoting nothing less than social\nDarwinism, or “the survival of the fittest”.\n“This shows just how scientifically astute developed nations’ approaches to virus prevention are,” reads one ironic response on Chinese social media. “Combatting the virus by employing the Darwinian model of natural selection highlights the unique appeal of modern science.”\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Taiwan accuses China of waging cyber 'war' to disrupt virus fight. TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s foreign minister on Saturday accused giant neighbor China of waging cyber “war” on the island to disrupt its fight against the coronavirus by using fake news, as the island Beijing claims as its own reported a jump in new cases\nThe coronavirus outbreak has strained already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing, with Taiwan especially angry at China’s efforts to block its participation at the World Health Organization (WHO).\nChina says Taiwan is merely one of its provinces with no right to membership of the WHO. Taiwan has called China “vile” for not allowing it real time information about the virus from the WHO. China says Taiwan gets the information it needs.\nThis week Taiwan’s government reported an increase in fake online reports about the virus on the island, and blamed China’s “internet army” for being behind the misinformation. China has not responded to the allegations.\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter that Chinese officials claim to care about the health of the Taiwanese “as if we’re blood relatives”.\nHe added: “But while #Taiwan is dealing with #COVID19 originating from #Wuhan, their cyber warriors are waging war to disrupt our efforts.

The island has long claimed China is intentionally using fake news to undermine its democracy and people’s faith in the government. China has previously denied the accusations.\nAdding to the tensions, China has in recent weeks been flying fighter jets and bombers close to the island.

SINGAPORE — Almost three times more cases of the Covid-19 virus could have been found globally if the rest of the world possessed the same “gold standard” detection capability as Singapore, a study by Harvard University researchers has found. \n “We consider the detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020 in Singapore to be a gold standard of near-perfect detection,” said the report’s authors, adding that they had used a model to estimate the probability of detection in other countries relative to Singapore. \n The world is detecting imported cases of Covid-19 at 38 per cent of Singapore’s ability to do so, said four epidemiologists from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in the study, that has not yet been peer-reviewed. \n “Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the Covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection,” said the researchers. \n The pre-print report, which was uploaded on online medical archive medRxiv, looked at aggregated data of imported cases as of Feb 4 from the World Health Organization (WHO), taking into account 191 territories around the world. \n Imported cases are those with known travel history from China. \n The researchers also compared the records with air travel data from various sources, including the International Air Travel Association, and the surveillance capacity of nations based on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which last year ranked Singapore’s preparedness for major disease outbreaks below Malaysia and Thailand. \n Using a model to determine how well countries have detected imported cases, the researchers picked Singapore as a benchmark based on its demonstrated ability to pick up confirmed carriers of Sars-CoV-2, the technical name of the virus which causes the disease Covid-19. \n They also cited a previous study, also by a similar team of Harvard researchers, which found that among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore had “the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume”. \n The previous study named Singapore as a statistical anomaly which had 12 more reported import cases than what had been expected, based on daily travel volume. \n The same report uploaded online last Tuesday had suggested that Indonesia, which has not detected any cases of Covid-19 so far, might have missed cases. The report was called “insulting” by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be “helpful” and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state’s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore’s capacity. \n “Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,” the study said. \n However, Singapore’s detection is “probably not 100 per cent efficient”, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. “Singapore’s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,” the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country’s detection capacity — and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n “(This coul\nd lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,” the study said.\n"}, {"content": "Portugal has two more ambulances dedicated to suspected cases of coronavirus.

Luis Meira explained that at the time the fire department went to the factory where the Italian technician was present, this was not yet a case validated and there was an indication that he would be having difficulty breathing. Therefore, he said, the priority was to respond immediately to the patient. And that when the case was validated, he was in isolation and was referred to the reference hospital.\nAn article signed by four public health specialists in the scientific journal of the Portuguese Medical Acts, published this Thursday, warns that Portugal may not be prepared to contain any cases of infection with the new coronavirus.

The social tranquility part\" took over.\n\"People could have been talked to first and reassured. But the first priority is to get the patient to the right hospital and to be safe,\" he said, stressing that \"sometimes validation processes are complex.\" Which is why it takes longer before a validation is given or not.\nAnd rejected the criticism in the article. \"We have been prepared in the past and are now. The proof is that we have found suspicious cases, validated and routed to the right hospitals. The three other situations, as you know, arrived quickly and exemplary to your hospital.

A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants.\nOver the past month, Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19.\nStill, only one positive test from Atalanta has been announced.\n\"Some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,\" Tommasi said. \"Other squads tested everyone. These are individual choices.\n\"The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder.\"\nWith the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic, Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals - which again would be the club's biggest game in its history.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked\nenough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)\n"}, {"content": "Wuhan quarantine: trapped in the epicenter of coronavirus. There were few people on the streets of Wuhan this morning. A layer of pollution covered the sky, making it look gray. At 10 a.m. on Thursday and 3 a.m. on the Spanish Peninsula, the veto announced by local authorities on Wednesday came into force. Since then, until further notice, 11 million people have been unable to leave and no one can enter, making the city in Central China a closed city. Therefore, the Chinese government intends to prevent the spread of the newly discovered 2019-ncov coronavirus, which has made significant progress at home and abroad in recent days. The latest data show that 18 people died and about 634 people were infected.\nThis measure applies to all flights, trains and buses and subway services. For example, in the cloud express station, all entrances have a fence except one entrance. There, a security guard who asked not to be named said that the number was much lower than usual before closing at 10 a.m. He admitted that he was \"eager to go home\". The ban also applies to intercity taxis, although you can see some taxis on the street, and there is no driver in Didi, a telephone application similar to Uber. The highway was cut off and private cars could not leave the city.\nThe blockade is one of the measures, including the most serious action protocol announced by the State Council on Wednesday, although the program is still listed as the second highest class B infectious disease. Another provision is the mobilization of the armed forces. A nearby city, Huanggang, 70 kilometers from Wuhan, will also close public buses and trains, its mayor announced late Thursday. According to Reuters, the authorities also ordered the closure of entertainment venues, such as cinemas or Internet cafes, for 7.5 million residents of the town, and asked residents not to leave except under special circumstances, as will the relatively small Ezhou, Of a million residents.\nIn the face of the announcement of the siege of Wuhan, many people went to the airport and railway station in order to leave the city before the siege took effect. One of them is Nicky, a 22-year-old Taiwanese student, who came to Wuhan to visit a friend. Nicky believed she would arrive on time because she found a private driver who was willing to drive. \"I'm in the wrong place!\" he said goodbye as he ran downstairs pushing his bag. According to local media reports, Wuhan airport has been overcrowded, with up to 100 meters waiting in line.\nThrough this decision, the government intends to isolate the center of the outbreak, which is particularly important in view of the upcoming Chinese New Year. The festival will be held next Saturday, followed by a week of national holidays. People are used to visiting relatives or traveling abroad. At present, the number of displaced persons may reach 3 billion, which is the largest population migration in the world. Wuhan has a population of 11 million, more than London or New York. It is also a railway transportation hub in China. On Thursday, unlike usual, the windows of many stores in the city are typical decorations these days, although most of them are empty.\nTherefore, they followed Zhong Nanshan's instructions. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist, led a research team to try to replicate coronavirus. \"Quarantine should be the top priority from the moment when human to human transmission has been confirmed (this has been excluded by this week),\" he said at a news conference on Tuesday. Zhong, 84, is the most outstanding figure in the field of infectious diseases in China. He became famous in 2002 for leading the government to deal with SARS. The epidemic also originated in China and claimed 700 lives.\nAfter the global crisis, it left a mark in people's memory. \"Isolation is the most effective measure, because so far, we have not developed a special drug to deal with coronavirus,\" the researchers said.\nAnother requirement put forward by the local authorities in Wuhan is the mandatory wearing of masks in public places. This object has become the first line of defense against the outbreak of the epidemic. Without it, no one will act. On the other hand, in many supermarkets with sufficient supply, the shelves corresponding to masks are empty. \"They're all sold out, even in the warehouse. I don't know when I can get more,\" said a clerk on Qinghuang street, five kilometers from the city center, pointing to his store.\nBut in the face of more and more cases, hospitals seem to be in short supply. The Beijing News reported that many of them were crowded with patients, and some of them lined up outside despite the low temperature. The infusion room is also very crowded. Many patients are crowded in the corridor with droppers. \"My father has been suffering from high fever and dyspnea since January 2. After several ineffective treatments, on October 10 last year, the hospital informed us that they could not let him in hospital because they did not have free beds. We were transferred to Wuhan Xinhua Hospital, and they could not take care of him. His condition deteriorated because \"He has had a fever for 12 days and has to walk to the health center every day to give him oxygen: no admission, no examination, no isolation,\" said a twitter like microblog user.\nOn Wednesday night, the arrival area of Wuhan airport was empty. The last flight of the day carried only 20 passengers, all wearing masks. One of them is Xi'an Ping, 28. He is an employee of a financial company. He came to the city for a professional commitment. \"It's very important. If it was anything else, I wouldn't think I would come. I chose to limit my travel to the maximum, so I'll fly home tomorrow. I'm worried,\" he said. Before exercising the veto, Xi'an pinyin is likely to fail to achieve its purpose. On the same plane, stewardess Lian shared that the number of passengers on these flights decreased significantly. She herself is from Wuhan, although she quoted a popular proverb to explain her tranquility: \"the world's blessings do not eat goods, and the world's goods replenish more goods\", \"happiness is not a disaster, and disaster cannot escape.\"\nOutside the airport, we didn't see any special safety measures. The driver Zheng Wang complained, \"I've been waiting in line for five hours. No passengers came, so we didn't move.\" Her 13-year-old son has not attended school since January 10 last year because the school has been closed. When asked about his credibility of the official affected figures, he replied: \"it's best not to talk about this.\" The government threatened to punish anyone who encouraged rumors and local or regional governments who covered up the facts.\nAlthough Xi'an pin is very upset, he is still very optimistic. He doesn't remember the SARS epidemic because \"it's too small\", but he believes it won't be so serious this time. \"China is now a powerful country. Our leader Xi Jinping assured the people that we will do our best. I believe we will control the virus soon.\"\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: What is the risk in Germany?.\nWith the surprisingly large Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, there is growing concern about new cases in Germany. At first, undetected chains of infection are also possible here, according to experts. This is known for the Sars-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes:\nHow contagious is the new Coronavirus?\nA value that many other people infect an infected person in the medium can still not be stated with certainty. It is clear that the virus spreads through droplet infection, such as coughing and talking. And it is also clear that the pathogen is significantly more infectious than initially assumed: unlike the closely related Sars pathogen, the Covid-19 virus also multiplies in the neck area. In the upper respiratory tract, the path of infection is much shorter than when an organism first has to get out of the lung and into another person's lungs. Flu viruses also multiply in the throat.\nIn addition, initial results indicate that the virus can also be spread over the digestive system and at least for a few days over surfaces. A previously underestimated risk might be that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19 disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of Sars-CoV-2 could be detected, for example Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectiology and tropical medicine at the Munich clinic Schwabing, explained.\nThe extent to which people who are largely or entirely symptom-free may be infectious is not yet clear.\nWhat is the risk of infection in Germany?\nThe risk that clusters similar to those in Italy may occur elsewhere in Europe is currently considered to be moderat e to high, it was said on Sunday evening of the European Prevention Year that ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said that it is expected that there will be more cases in Italy and possibly in other parts of the EU in the coming days.\nExperts believe that there could also be further infection chains in European countries, of which no one has previously anticipated, including in Germany. \"At some point, undetected infections are likely to be noticed suddenly,\" Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently explained.\nWhat would an outbreak in Germany mean?\nAn infection wave in this country could mean, among other things, full waiting areas and medical practices, occupied intensiv e beds and completely overloaded health offices, Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently said. Charite CEO Heyo Kroemer stressed in mid-February that preparations were being made intensively. In the case of Sars-CoV-2 infections in the country, however, the facilities would have room for manoeuvre, for example by moving non-urgent operations.\nThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said that the aim in Germany was to delay a wave of disease in order to prevent the Covid-19 and the current flu waves from collapsing. \"We must try with reasonable effort to slow down the spread in order to alleviate an intense strain on the health system. \"The number of infections should be extended for as long as possible.\"\nHow dangerous is the virus?\nAccording to an analysis presented by the Chinese health authority, a 2,3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. Therefore, the main victims are elderly people and those with severe pre-conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. In people over 80 years the death rate calculated from the data available there is In the group of ten to 39-year-old people, 0,2 percent of the infected, i.e. about two percent of the infected, die in this age group in China.\nIn the vast majority of cases, according to the health authority more than 80 percent, people infected with the Covid-19 pathogen show only mild symptoms. Few 14 percent of those affected develop severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, almost five percent of them are life-threatening.\neffects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multiorgan failure.\nThe Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) also spoke of a good 80-percent mild course of infection, referring to the data analysis from China. There are also relatively few cases in children, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. It is still unclear why this is so.\nExperts believe that mortality is actually lower than expected in China, partly because many mild-acting infections are not recorded in Chinese statistics. But there are no reliable analyses of mortality from other countries so far.\nWhat symptoms does the new Coronavirus cause?\nMany people have only mild cold symptoms with frostbite and sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, fever, cough and respiratory problems can occur, as they do with a flu. Headaches or diarrhoea are also possible. The incubation period, the period between infection and onset of symptoms, is usually two to 14 days at the current stage. That's the reason we isolate suspect cases for two weeks.\nHow can the new lung disease be treated?\nThere is no special treatment for Covid-19 disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\nIs there a protective vaccine?\nNope. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines such as the flu vaccine. However, the development of protective vaccination takes a long time. The first experimental vaccines could be available this year, said the virologist Gerd Sutter of the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich recently. Whether and when they could be tested on humans is another matter.\" The development of a vaccine is a long, arduous process, especially the approval and clinical examination of a candidate.\"\nWHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that the first vaccination tests on humans could begin in three to four months. However, a certified vaccine for extensive use is probably only available in 18 months.\nDo we have a pandemic at Covid-19 yet?\nA pandemic often refers to the spread of a disease in humans across all continents. \"If there are transmission chains there and not just individual entrances by travellers. Reports of such infection chains are still missing from Africa and America. The question is whether certain African and South American countries are even tested for the virus and cases are detected, the Berliner explained Virologist Christian Drosten.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) no longer uses the term pandemic and does not explain it. The seriousness of a disease is measured only by the declaration of an \"emergency of international importance\". It has nothing to do with the common definition of pandemic.\nWhat kind of virus is Sars-CoV-2?\nThe pathogen Sars-2-CoV, which is probably passed on to humans at a wildlife market in Wuhan in China in November or December, is one of the coronavirus. They are so named because of the zackenlike structures on their surface. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans, such as snoring or Cough.\nSars-CoV-2 is included by three known to cause sometimes severe symptoms. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, also originating from China (severe acute respiratory syndrome), 2002/2003 became known to die around 8000 cases, about 800 people. It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected to November 2019, nearly 860- about every third died.\nThe Covid-19-agent Sars-CoV-2 is genetically very closely related to the Sars-CoV, which is why it has been given a very similar technical name.\nHow can I protect myself?\nTo protect against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. The benefits of normal breathing masks, as currently seen in China everywhere on the streets, are estimated by experts as rather low. desch\nand do not touch surfaces touched by many people such as doorknobs, handles and elevator buttons.\nWhat good is a mouthpiece?\n\"Healthy people travelling in Germany do not need a mask\", says a spokesman for the German Association of Pharmaceutical Associations (ABDA). A simple mouth-nose protection, like that worn by nurses and doctors during surgeries, does not protect against infection with the new Sars-CoV-2 virus anyway.\nIn addition, there are proper respiratory masks with built-in filter. However, a drip transmission infection can only prevent so-called FFP2 and FFP3 masks, if they are sitting correctly. \"In everyday life this is nonsensical. \"Bernd Salzberger of Regensburg University Hospital, president of the German Society for Infectiology, said. Especially with such a mask, it is difficult to breathe.\nBecause of the new Coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks and they are scarcely supplied. This is explained by the Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesale (PHAGRO).\nWhen will Coronavirus be tested?\nIn the routine monitoring of acute respiratory diseases in Germany with the help of selected medical practices, attention is now also being paid to the new Coronavirus. As Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) announced in Berlin on Monday, the Working Group Influenza (AGI) has carried out a study on Sars-CoV-2 \"integrated into the spectrum of the pathogens to be investigated.\" According to RKI data, respiratory tests are now analyzed from patients from 100 to 150 medical practices. The MDR had previously reported on the subject.\nThroughout the year, the AGI monitors, among other things, the course and severity of respiratory diseases and the characteristics of the respective circulating agents. Trends are to be identified from the sample of participating medical practices. Priority is given to the flu, which affects thousands of people in Germany every year. The test will also be carried out on rhinoviruses, which are often behind colds and colds.\nWhere is the latest information?\nThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) and the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) have set up such websites. (dpa)\n"}, {"content": "Wuhan virus: What we know about the outbreak so far. SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month. \n Here is what we know about the outbreak so far: \n IT IS SIMILAR, BUT SO FAR MILDER THAN SARS \n The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. \n It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". \n Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. \n The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. \n However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. \n SUSPECTED TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ANIMALS, STARTED AT A SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN \n The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. \n  \n The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \n \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. \n Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. \n HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION, NOT AIRBORNE BUT SPREAD THROUGH WATER DROPLETS \n Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. \n It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. \n Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. \n There is currently no vaccine for the virus. \n RECOMMENDED PROTECTION \n Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. \n They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. \n Singapore’s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. \n Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. \n  \n CITIES LOCKED DOWN IN CHINA \n More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. \n  \n Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. \n Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. \n Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai’s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. \n Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. \n Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temple\ns. \n NINE COUNTRIES REPORT CASES, INCLUDING SINGAPORE \n The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. \n So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. \n Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 – a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort. \n  \n He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. \n Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man’s 37-year-old son. \n Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. \n Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "With coronavirus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine.  When a newly organised vaccine research group at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) met for the first time this week, its members had expected to be able to ease into their work. But their mandate is to conduct human trials for emerging health threats - and their first assignment came at shocking speed.\nIn just three months time, they likely will be testing the first of a number of potential experimental vaccines against the new SARS-like coronavirus that is spreading in China and beyond.\n\"I told them, 'you are going to have your baptism of fire, folks',\" Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within NIH, said of his inaugural address to the group this week.\nThree months from gene sequence to initial human testing would be the fastest the agency has ever gotten such a vaccine off the ground, Fauci said.\nThe outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, as of Friday had infected more than 800 people in China and killed 26.\nCoronavirus cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States.\nChinese scientists were able to quickly identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and officials posted it publicly within a few days, allowing scientific research teams to get to work right away.\nWith the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development work without needing a sample of the virus.\nDuring the deadly 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, it took US scientists 20 months to go from genetic sequence to the first phase of human trials. By that time, the outbreak was under control.\nThis time, research groups worldwide are already executing plans to test vaccines, treatments and other countermeasures to stop the newly identified virus from spreading globally.\nMULTI-PRONGED APPROACH\nThey are attacking from several angles, with global health and epidemic response agencies hoping at least one treatment will be in human trials within a few months.\nFauci's agency is partnering with US biotech Moderna Inc, which specializes in vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.\nThat team hopes to make an RNA vaccine based on one of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that gives the family of viruses their name, an approach that, unlike many vaccines, would not expose people to the virus.\nAt the University of Queensland in Australia, scientists backed by the global health emergency group the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said they are working on what they describe as a \"molecular clamp\" vaccine approach.\nThe technology adds a gene to viral proteins to stabilize them and trick the body into thinking it is seeing a live virus and create antibodies against it.\nKeith Chappell, an expert in the University's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, said the technology is designed as \"a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses.\"\nIt has already shown promising results in lab tests on other dangerous viruses such as Ebola and the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)- a cousin of SARS and the Wuhan virus.\nNovavax, which already has a vaccine in development against MERS, says it is now working on one for the Wuhan coronavirus.\nScientists also are turning to infection-fighting proteins known as monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, that were developed against the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.\nThe hope is that similarities with the Wuhan virus will offer enough overlap in the antibodies to help people infected in the China outbreak.\nVir Biotechnology Chief Scientific Officer Herbert Virgin said his company has a library of monoclonal antibodies that have shown some success against SARS and MERS in lab tests.\nSome of these antibodies have been shown to neutralize coronaviruses, Virgin said, and \"may have the potential to treat and prevent (the) Wuhan coronavirus.\"\n"}, {"content": "WHO PROMISES SUPPORT TO ST.

Campbell, CEO of Asia Group (Washington-based advisory group), and Rush Doshi, Director of the China Strategic Initiative at the Brookings Institution study centre (in the same city). \"Now, through industrial mobilization as in wartime, [Beijing] has increased production more than ten times, giving it the ability to make them available to the world,\" the two authors note.\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, agreed to send two million surgical masks, 200 thousand breathing masks and 500 thousand tests to the European Union. Von der Leyen said that the EU is increasing production, but that it will be a while before the material is ready.\nIt also recalled that when China began to be hit, the European Union sent over fifty tonnes of protective equipment. \"China has not forgotten,\" and \"today we are at the center of the pandemic, and we are the ones who need this equipment.\"\nThis support for the European Union goes hand in hand with what China has already given not only to Italy but also to other countries, such as Spain or Belgium, and which has also included sending doctors. Not everything is donated, there is also sale (as agreed with St. John's Hospital in Porto, facilitated by local authorities), and not everything is done by the government, billionaire Jack Ma (from the online shopping platform Alibaba) donated a million masks and hundreds of thousands of test kits to the United States.\nThe Chinese President, Xi Jinping, told the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who hoped to create a Silk Health Route, in reference to his Silk New Route project, which has been viewed with particular suspicion by some European countries, especially the North. As for the head of the Spanish Government Pedro Sanchez, Xi said that \"after the storm comes bonanza\", and that at this time the two should increase cooperation and trade.\nChina's main strategy, writes Politics, is to show that \"the country that was the source of the virus is now on the front line to try to save humanity, while the European Union cannot act and the other superpower in the world is busy pointing fingers\".\nThese are real aid efforts, experts point out, noting that they are not only altruistic, but also that political ends deserve attention. \"There is nothing wrong with China helping European and other countries, especially now that it has gained an advantage by containing the coronavirus,\" said Noah Barkin, from the German Marshall Fund study centre, to the British diary The Guardian. \"But it is also clear that [Beijing] sees this aid as a propaganda tool.\"\nThe greatest asset is aid to European countries and, noted by the South China Morning Post, direct aid to the European Union marks a diplomatic difference in relation to actions with individual countries. Here, his attitude contrasts with the least solidarity of Europeans, especially in relation to Italy, the first and most affected. And even more, compared to the attitude of the United States, with US President Donald Trump trying to buy for the US the exclusive rights to a vaccine to be developed in Germany (the US denied this attempt, the German Government confirmed), and to subject the Schengen countries to an entry ban without prior coordination. \"While Trump reaches Europe with a ban on travel, China is the\ngenerous and selfless friend,\"says Barkin.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn the Foreign Affairs article, Campbell and Doshi stressed that \"in the last seven decades, the status of the US as a global leader has been built not only on the basis of wealth and power but, as important as that, on the legitimacy that derives from the way it governs domestically, from the provision of global public goods, and the willingness to coordinate, and achieve, a global response to crises.\"\nNow on the issue of the current pandemic, which tests all three of these aspects, \"Washington so far is failing.\" And on the other hand, \"Beijing is moving swiftly and skilfully, taking advantage of the openness created by US mistakes, to fill the void and position himself as the global leader in responding to the pandemic.\"\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: G20 leaders meet on Thursday by video conference to discuss measures.

LONDON: Companies and tourists out of pocket from the global disruption caused by the virus epidemic in China risk meeting a cold shoulder from insurers, industry experts warn. \n Basic travel insurance policies are unlikely to cover epidemics. Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs. \n Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for \"travel disruption\" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans. \n \"We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,\" an Aviva spokeswoman said. \n Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer. \n The company said the outbreak was \"clearly a very urgent alert\" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied. \n CORONAVIRUS A \"KNOWN EVENT\" \n The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) said that most insurers \"consider the 2019-nCoV a known event\", and have issued consumer advisories on travel insurance claims related to or arising from the event. \n Customers should approach their insurers if they are in doubt about whether a claim is covered in their respective policies - this includes travel cancellation, flight postponement and trip curtailment arising from the coronavirus situation. \n They should also keep themselves updated on insurers' latest consumer advisories, GIA said. \n The eligibility of claims can be affected by a cut-off date for coverage, affected regions visited and reasons for travel disruption, it added. \n For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London. \n Communicable diseases will typically only be covered if airlines have taken out specialist coverage. But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return, Franks said. \n RIPPLE EFFECTS \n It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus, experts said. \n The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said. \n But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities. \n As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be \"paying very close attention to this\", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said. \n He cautioned individuals and companies: \"If someone travels (to China) against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.\" \n  \n RISK CALCULUS \n The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers. \n For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30 billion to US$50 billion. \n But China's economy accounted for 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data. \n More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away. \n The number of infections from the new virus stands at more than 20,000, and the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency. \n But health experts stress its mortality rate among patients is lower than for SARS. \n In a blog, Risk Management Solutions noted that several sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled in China, \"and all risk stakeholders will be anxious over the number of months before 2019-nCoV (the novel coronavirus) is contained\". \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates o\nn the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "British PM Boris Johnson calls PM Narendra Modi to discuss coronavirus crisis.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it takes 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) to implement a global plan to combat viruses in the next three months, this Wednesday was announced at a press conference. The WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to 11 and 12 in February to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are almost 25 thousand infected people and almost 500 deaths from this virus.\nFor now, the WHO has called for a fund of 675 million dollars to combat the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of these, 60 million dollars (about 54 million euros) will be for WHO operations and the rest for those countries that are especially at risk. This is the budget for the Strategic Plan of Preparation and Response, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and care for patients early, or to minimise the economic and social impact.\n\"My greatest concern is in countries that today have no systems to operate to detect people infected by the virus,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Urgent support is needed to reinforce health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and healthcare professionals.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, also said that \"very soon\" a WHO team will go to China.\n\"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on preparatory measures,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency programme. \"This is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.\"\nOne of the major issues is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirus. So far, there's no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation on the development of new treatments, the WHO has made a point of reinforcing this week that \"there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV\" and that several experts are meeting this month to set the priorities for these advances.\nAlthough there has been no specific treatment, the Chinese Government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of clouded interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus with patients infected with the new coronavirus.\nAs for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a version of the laboratory-grown virus, which may be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Ready Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the objective is to start clinical trials in June.\nThe Russian health minister, Mikhail Murashko, also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia hope it will take at least eight to ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,\" said Russian news agency Interfax. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China.\nThe choice of a new name for this virus, temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by the WHO, may appear somewhat smaller. \"The name [official] of the new virus is very late because the focus so far has been on public health response,\" said Crystal Watson, a teacher at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), cited on the BBC website. However, there are some reasons why the name choice becomes more of a priority. \"When we do not have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like'Chinese virus'and that they may create a negative reaction against certain populations.\"\nThe International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) is responsible for choosing the name. According to the Committee's guidelines, the name shall not include geographical locations, names of persons, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or Indian\nIndustry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). A group from ICTV is already deliberating on the new name.\nOfficial names can also become a problem. Moreover, in 2015, WHO criticised the name MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities.\nThere is still a lot to uncover about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to be already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would have had symptoms only days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers had only relied on the accounts of German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian Food Safety and Health Authority spoke to the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data substantiate the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission takes place.\nThis Wednesday also announced the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronavirus. The Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus only thirty hours after birth, referred to in the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby's mother before delivery. This Wednesday also confirmed four more cases in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby.\nAlso on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed in the last week that a doctor who issued an alert on the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began in mid-December when he wrote a message in his group of college friends. In this message, you said that in your hospital there were seven patients with SARS-like symptoms. He would also ask that his friends and their families be careful.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs the message eventually went viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could lead to his arrest for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor eventually had to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he became infected with the new coronavirus after treating a patient.\nThe new coronavirus has not yet arrived in Africa, but the African Disease Control and Prevention Centres have already activated their emergency operations center to tackle the virus and are organising a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries.\nAn isolation ward is already in place at the Khartoum hospital in Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the equipment to detect the virus. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms. The Democratic Republic of Congo has already prevented its citizens from travelling to China. Burkina Faso asked Chinese citizens to postpone their trips.

SINGAPORE — A link between two Covid-19 church clusters, where the source of infection had previously eluded the authorities, was finally established. This was done through a serological test, a new testing method developed by Duke-NUS Medical School.  \n The test is able to detect past infections in someone who has recovered from it. Individuals who had contracted the coronovirus before will have high levels of virus-specific antibodies in their blood which can be picked up by this test.   \n The authorities ran this test on Case 83, a 54 year-old Singaporean man, and Case 91, a 58-year-old Singaporean woman and the latest case to be announced on Tuesday (Feb 25). They then discovered that both of them had earlier contracted Covid-19 but were not detected at the time. \n They also found that the two, who are married, had a link with another married couple from Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9) who had visited Life Church and Missions Singapore. Both couples were there on the same day on Jan 19. \n Case 91, the wife, developed symptoms on Jan 23 and Case 83, the husband, had symptoms on Jan 28. \n On Jan 25, both of them attended a Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 which other confirmed cases attended, including Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who worked at Grace Assembly of God church.  \n On Feb 1, 6 and 10, the wife sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic. \n At the same time, records also showed that her husband had gone to see a GP repeatedly on Feb 1, 5, 6 and 10.  \n During the period under investigations later, the couple were not sick and did not show symptoms, but records by the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed that the wife had gone to the emergency department of Sengkang General Hospital earlier on Jan 26 with symptoms consistent with Covid-19.  \n She was not marked as a suspect case at the time because she had no recent travel history to China. The case definition has since been expanded to include those who have not been to China in the last 14 days. \n On Feb 18, both of them showed up at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to undergo tests, including the serological tests. It was then confirmed that they had earlier been infected with the virus. On Feb 19, results showed that the husband had Covid-19 while results for the wife were confirmed on Feb 22. \n Together with help from the police doing contact tracing, the authorities found that the Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive was the common event that this Singaporean couple attended together with Case 66 from the Grace Assembly of God church. \n  Illustration: Samuel Woo/TODAY \n As of Tuesday, there are 23 cases from the Grace Assembly of God cluster — making it the biggest cluster — and seven cases from Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar.  \n Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the serological tests gave the authorities the confidence to establish that the cases reported at the Grace Assembly of God cluster was not a case of widespread community transmission from other sources. \n Rather, it was a result of a sequential series of events, he said at a media briefing on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force managing the public health crisis. \n MOH said that the spread between the clusters started with Case 8 (a 56 year-old woman) and Case 9 (a 56 year-old man), who are Chinese nationals.  \n The couple arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 from Wuhan, China — the epicentre of the outbreak.   \n They likely infected the Singaporean couple who went on to pass the infection to Case 66 at the Chinese New Year gathering, the ministry said. Case 66 later passed the infection to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God church. \n Case 66 was thus found to be the primary case in the Grace Assembly of God cluster.  \n Some people were exposed to him at a staff meeting at the Tanglin branch of the church and they in turn infected other church members, MOH said.  \n Writing on Facebook, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the authorities “discovered an important link” between two existing clusters, including the biggest cluster at Grace Assembly of God.  \n He noted that Cases 83 and 91 had only mild symptoms earlier and had not been diagnosed with Covid-19. But the new serological test later confirmed that they had been infected earlier, and link\ned the two clusters together.  \n “This breakthrough would not have been possible without close cooperation among the Ministry of Health, Singapore Police Force and researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, who developed the serological test, the world's first, here in Singapore. My thanks to all of you for a job well done!” he added. \n"}, {"content": "big read: 17 years on, s’pore puts sars lessons to test in fight against wuhan coronavirus. SINGAPORE — Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Chua Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment — N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns — was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.  \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.  \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.  \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus — or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus — was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic.  \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus — which has spread to several countries — as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).  \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.  \n As of noon on Friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative. There are no deaths in Singapore thus far. \n At the heart of the city-state’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.  \n  Medical workers conduct routine checks to guests before the start of an NKF show at a Mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against SARS in 2003. TODAY file photo \n “After Sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  \n “I think we are much better prepared now.”  \n Currently, Singapore is at Dors condition (Dorscon) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, which would have applied in the case of Sars, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested — since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY.  \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory — Sars and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating Sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing tha\nt could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n Sars first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.  \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on March 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  Church goers being screened for their body temperature by the thermal imaging system at New Creation Church before attending prayers in 2003.

Photos: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH.  \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers told TODAY that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in Sars and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.  \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient — a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan — tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when Sars caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Adviser: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat \n Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry \n Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources \n Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress \n Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education \n Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs \n Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development \n Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the\nMOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said.  \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture — you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, where it was — in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang —“flying blind”.  \n During the Sars crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing Sars as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the Sars crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. Sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.  \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with Sars,” she added.  \n  Tan Tock Seng Hospital's moderate risk area during the 2003 Sars period. TODAY file photo \n   Notices at Tan Tock Seng Hospital informing visitors and patients of the Wuhan coronavirus. Photos: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During Sars, TTSH was known as “Sars Central”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient — who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH — created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH.  \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.  \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during Sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis.  \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n Visitors, staff and patients entering Gleneagles Hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. Photo: Justin Ong/TODAY \n For the general public, the\nGovernment will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.  \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too — student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  Nanyang Technological University's Graduate Hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added.  \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.  \n Prof Pangestu told TODAY that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  With the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.  \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available — robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu.  \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it — this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there\nis a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”.  \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS  \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.  \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour.   But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the Sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”.  \n  Surgical masks sold out at Guardian Pharmacy at Changi Airport on Jan 29, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said.  \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all… There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening… But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION  \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour — the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happ\nen again. The issue became such a problem during the Sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.  \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS  \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  ​Preschool children getting their health checked by teachers at My First Skool at Buangkok Crescent on Jan 28, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.”  \n This will be critical during the “surge response”— when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters — mostly residents — also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.  \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for Sars but info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have Sars. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the Sars suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about Sars in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information — and accurate information — is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19! Brussels supports the repatriation of EU citizens on a cruise in Japan. The European Commission announced this Wednesday that it will co-finance the repatriation of EU citizens who were on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama, Japan, by aircraft leaving Italy.\nAfter a two-week quarantine due to the new coronavirus (Covid-19), these European passengers will be repatriated on Italian planes, the first aircraft has already left for Japan and the second will leave tonight, the EU executive has said in communication.\nIt will be up to the Italian medical team, on board each of these flights, to assess the passengers on the spot and \"only those who have been reported as negative Covid-19 cases or who have no symptoms of the disease will be able to board\" in these repatriation operations, explains Brussels.\n\"Upon arrival in Europe, passengers will begin a new period of quarantine organised and monitored by each Member State,\" added the Community executive, noting that the official numbers and nationalities of these passengers will only be known in the next few days.\nThis support provided by Brussels follows on from the activation of the European Civil Protection Mechanism, and there is therefore provision for cofinancing by the European Commission of the costs of these repatriation operations. Up to now, within the framework of this mechanism, Brussels has already supported the repatriation of 400 EU citizens in China in aircraft organised by France and Germany.\nQuoted by the note, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, points out that'the EU continues to work 24-hour hours a day, seven days a week, both to support the Member States and China'. \"Currently, we are still working to send supplies to China in the coming days\", says the person responsible.\nAround 500 passengers left the Diamond Princess cruise ship this Wednesday, which is docked in Yokohama, Japan, after two weeks'quarantine due to the new coronavirus (Covid-19). The quarantine, much criticized by passengers confined to the ship, could not prevent the contagion of more than 600 people on board.\nThe failure of the quarantine was underlined when authorities announced today more 79 cases of contagion by the new coronavirus, Invi-19, raising the total on the ship to 621. People with positive tests for the new coronavirus are being taken to medical centers for treatment.\nThe Japanese authorities should spend the next three days conducting the landing of about two.000 passengers. The Covid-19 coronavirus has already caused 2.004 deaths in mainland China and infected more than 74 thousand people worldwide.

PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933.

Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned aga\ninst such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses.

SINGAPORE — The move to impose travel restrictions from coronavirus-hit China could have impacted bilateral relations, which was why Singapore made a “special effort\" to explain why this measure was necessary, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament on Monday (March 2). \n Singapore had given Chinese officials a “heads-up” before its public announcement on Jan 31, which had barred any new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering the city-state, said Dr Balakrishnan in the debate on his ministry’s budget. \n He was addressing questions from Mr Vikram Nair, Member of Parliament (MP) for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' efforts during the Covid-19 outbreak. \n In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan said that the disease has now spread globally and that diplomacy was key in coordinating information as well as repatriation missions for Singaporeans, when two flights brought back 266 Singaporeans and their families from Wuhan in China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n “Our embassy in Beijing had to coordinate closely with the PRC (People’s Republic of China) and Hubei provincial governments to arrange these repatriation missions,” he said. \n Yet, Singapore was aware that its difficult decision to impose travel restrictions on travellers from mainland China could affect diplomatic relations, Dr Balakrishnan said. \n These measures were not directed at any country, nationality or race, he stressed, adding that stringent measures were necessary to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in Singapore, or being re-exported to other countries. \n In his speech, Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, later explained in Mandarin that high-level officials in China had said that they understood why Singapore had to impose the travel restrictions. \n “When Minister Balakrishnan spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi over the phone early this year, he also thanked the Chinese government for their overwhelming assistance, for letting more than 200  Singaporeans and their families to smoothly leave Wuhan via an airplane and return to Singapore,\" Mr Tan said. \n \"At the same time, we also assisted Chinese citizens stranded in Singapore to return to Wuhan. We must continue to help China during this difficult period of fighting the virus.” \n Dr Balakrishnan said that his Chinese counterpart had “conveyed China’s understanding of the actions we had taken due to the unique circumstances faced by Singapore”. China had also expressed their gratitude for Singapore’s efforts and support during the health crisis. \n Singapore has sent testing equipment and test kits developed here to Wuhan, as well as personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. More than S$6 million were raised by the Singapore Red Cross for affected communities in China, he said. \n Besides China, Dr Balakrishnan said that his ministry has also been working with the international community to tackle Covid-19, including the Special Meeting of the Asean Coordinating Council and the Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers Meeting in Vientiane, Laos last month, where delegates “reaffirmed the importance of openness, decisiveness and co-operation to collectively address the crisis”.\n"}, {"content": "Santa Maria da Feira guarantees four hotels for health professionals near the hospital.

During the recent Chinese New Year celebrations, the Wuhan virus was the hot topic around my family’s dinner table, with many relatives fretting about how virulent the new coronavirus is. I’m sure similar conversations took place across the island. \n Judging by online activities, the virus is the talk of the town. “Wuhan virus” has been a top search term on Google and trending on Twitter for many days now. \n Turn on the television or check out a news website and you will also see plenty of coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has dubbed 2019-nCoV. \n The outbreak has caused global alarm, and understandably so. It is a new pathogen, and scientists know little about it. \n Fear of the unknown is a very human trait that has helped keep our species alive through the millennia. It keeps us from blundering into potentially dangerous situations without first finding out more about what to expect and how to prepare ourselves. \n But we should also avoid letting our emotions get the better of us. \n Reflexivity — the act of critically examining our own thoughts and feelings — is important. \n Before concluding that the ongoing viral epidemic is a catastrophe, take a step back and understand the reasons why many people are afraid. \n Much of it has to do with the availability heuristic. Heuristics are mental shortcuts our minds use to make thinking faster and less effortful. Unfortunately, they are error-prone. \n The availability heuristic is used when we make judgements about the likelihood of something. Quite often, the judgements we arrive at turn out to be inaccurate. \n A classic example is this: We tend to be afraid of flying in airplanes but not riding in cars. But statistically speaking, we are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash. \n Why does the availability heuristic make such mistakes? This is because it judges how likely something is based on how easy it is to think of examples of that thing happening. \n We can think of many examples of fatal plane crashes because such incidents tend to be widely covered by the media. \n But traffic accidents usually go unnoticed because they are an everyday occurrence and the media rarely covers them unless they involve multiple casualties or cause significant damage. \n The influence of the availability heuristic was very apparent in another epidemic — the 2009 swine flu, caused by the Influenza A H1N1 virus. \n I was only 12 then, and I remember how the grownups, their eyes glued to the day’s newspaper, spoke to one another in hushed tones about how bad the pandemic was and how many people were dying. \n Eventually, I caught the bug. But it was nothing a three-day stay in an isolation ward and a brief course of Tamiflu couldn’t fix. \n H1N1 is still around today, but has faded into obscurity. It is now just another flu virus — one of dozens responsible for the seasonal flu. \n Of course, we now know that the 2009 variant of H1N1 was a relatively mild strain. It infected up to 200 million people but its mortality rate was a modest 0.02 per cent. The mortality rate in Singapore was even lower at 0.004 per cent, with 18 fatalities from some 415,000 cases. \n It was a good illustration of how people’s imagined fears, fuelled by media coverage, can make a relatively small problem seem like a huge one thanks to the availability heuristic. \n It’s hard not to overestimate your likelihood of dying from H1N1 if you’re constantly reading reports about how thousands have already succumbed. \n To put the numbers in context, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) viruses — which are cousins of 2019-nCoV — have a 10 per cent and 34 per cent mortality rate respectively. \n The mortality rate of 2019-nCoV itself stands at below 3 per cent for now, though this could change if new information emerges about the virus or if it mutates into a more dangerous form. \n Meanwhile, the humble seasonal flu sickens up to a billion people — equivalent to roughly 15 per cent of the world’s population — every year, killing up to 650,000. \n Although this works out to a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, the sheer number of cases means that even now, we are far more likely to come down with — and subsequently die from — the regular flu than the Wuhan virus. \n So if you see someone coughing, keep your mind in check. Don’t immediately assume that they have the Wuhan virus. It’s probabl\ny just the regular flu. \n And when you are thinking and discussing with others about the outbreak, do your best to seek out the facts and use logical reasoning. \n Because the virus is new and little is known about it, people may fill the void of information with speculation and hearsay. \n It has already happened here. Fake news that individuals had died from the virus in Singapore has circulated on at least two occasions, forcing the Government to debunk the misinformation and even issue a general correction direction through the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office. \n It can be very tempting to share such rumours with family and friends, because they are dramatic and prey on our emotions. \n But apply some media literacy techniques first, before deciding whether to press the “send” button. \n Read about past epidemics and how viruses work on free information platforms like Wikipedia. Consume news from multiple outlets so you can corroborate the facts across different sources. \n As Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Jan 27 at a press conference about the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore: “This is not just a fight on the medical front, but a fight on the psychological front. We have to stay together, and do not panic.” \n In short, let’s not scare ourselves unnecessarily, and refrain from scaring one another too. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Jonathan Tiong is a fourth-year student at the National University of Singapore where he is majoring in Communications and New Media.\n"}, {"content": "Work to start on three possible China virus vaccines: epidemic response group.

LONDON - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus' ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.  \n With containment measures largely successful and the epidemic's epicentre now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.  \n But a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan's shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.  \n \"The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,\" said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.  \n \"If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.\"  \n The study used mathematical modelling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.  \n By lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.  \n  \n RESURGENCE FEARS  \n Those findings were \"crucial for policy makers everywhere\", said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.  \n Stunned by the disease's rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China's draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.  \n \"Our results won't look exactly the same in another country,\" said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. \"But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.\"  \n World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.  \n \"The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,\" he said.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.  \n Beijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times <NYT.N>, News Corp's <NWSA.O> Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.  \n The move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.  \n Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the \"real sick man of Asia.\"  \n Washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a \"deepening crackdown\" on independent reporting inside China.  \n Beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.  \n The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it \"deplores\" China's decision.  \n China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.  \n Beijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must \"declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.\"  \n  \n WAR OF WORDS  \n The latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.  \n The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing's move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in \"incredibly challenging\" times brought about by the coronavirus.  \n \"I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,\" he said. \"This is unfortunate...

Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\"  \n Time Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: \"We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\"  \n A representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.  \n  \n 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS'  \n A striking aspect of Beijing's move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.  \n That raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.  \n \"There's no precedent fo\nr China dictating who can and can’t report from Hong Kong openly,\" said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia programme coordinator. \"It very seriously erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom of the press.\"  \n The Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.  \n It said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.  \n Beijing said on Wednesday that its actions \"are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.\"  \n Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's latest move was a balanced response. \"This isn't apples to apples,\" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \"propaganda outlets.\"  \n China has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal's \"sick man\" column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologise, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing.

In the evening, the World Health Organisation saw no reason to call for an international health emergency. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn called for a prudent approach to lung disease.\" We take this very seriously, we are vigilant, but also with a cool head at the same time,\"he said in the ARD\"Days\".\n(dpa)\n"}, {"content": "OMS says coronavirus isn't a pandemic yet. The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced this Tuesday that the new coronavirus epidemic that has arisen in China is not yet a pandemic. \"We are not currently in a pandemic situation\", a term that applies to a global disease spreading situation, said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO Global Preparation Department for Infectious Risks.\n\"We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks,\" added the person responsible to the press. The term pandemic is used to describe situations where an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world.\nSylvie Briand also emphasized that there is currently an \"information epidemic\", an infodemic that may make it difficult to respond to the coronavirus epidemic.\nThe responsible WHO recalled that the cradle of the epidemic was the Hubei province in central Cinha. \"The transmission from man to man is intense and the Chinese authorities have taken measures\" to limit the spread of the disease.\n\"We hope that, based on these measures taken in Hubei, but also in other places where we have had cases, we can stop the transmission and get rid of that virus.\" He said, \"I am not saying it is easy, but we think it is possible.\"\nThe WHO leader also revealed that meetings are being held with representatives of the tourism sector to establish protection measures for those travelling.\nAfter declaring last Thursday the new coronavirus as an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures, the WHO pointed out that the use of masks does not fully protect against the virus, but added that anyone who is already in Inherited should not dispense with its use.\nThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which emerged last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, has already caused 427 dead and infected more than 20.400 people.\nIn addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of infection confirmed in 23 other countries, according to the organization.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19! How a world pandemic can create a political pandemonium. The spread of Covid-19 and the imminence of a major pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is putting governments before social problems of difficult resolution. Analysts heard by Lusa agency believe that a pandemic can create \"pandemonium\" situations and stress that several rulers fear the social repercussions of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a \"global village\" where phenomena do not recognise borders.\nOne visible case of this concern is the US President: concerned about the impact of the new coronavirus on his re-election attempt in November, Trump prevented a US citizen, who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan, from being treated in his Alabama home state, Calling Republican Senator Richard Shelby to make sure he followed his instructions.\nAnalysts say Covid-19's impact on the US elections may be a \"double-edged knife\": in the first hypothesis, the US economy is affected in the long term, weakening Trump's position, which has used the flag of economic performance; In a second scenario, the outbreak is short-lived, affecting the production of goods for a few months, with the offer to resume on the eve of the election, in a compact way, favoring Trump's position.\nAccording to American Political Journal, Trump has already asked his advisors to examine all scenarios and has requested a detailed report on emergency measures from the CDC. The CDC, in a document that was made public, warned the US President about the risk that \"the public health system will become overcrowded, with high rates of hospitalization and deaths\", and warned about the impact of a pandemic on transport systems.\nThe problem is global and the big variable is to know what size it will reach, says Jose Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, researcher at the Portuguese Institute for International Relations (IPRI-Nova). In statements to Lusa, this expert warns of the risks governments are taking if a pandemic spreads over long periods of time.\n\"The problem is of degree\", explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that may involve many thousands of infected people in the same country over a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of essential goods.\nFor the time being, in Europe, where cases of infection are beginning to multiply in various regions, governments are looking for mechanisms to contain the disease by triggering administrative mechanisms to isolate the virus.\nEven in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights, which make it impossible, for example, for a person who decides to disappear, to be sought by the police, even under the pretext of \"family interest\", the government has announced that it will make compulsory entry for infected people.\nThe topic of mandatory admission of an infected patient with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries, including Portugal, where experts are divided in the legal reading of the solutions.\nConstantino Sakellarides, a specialist in Public Health and who was responsible for the Directorate-General for Health in Portugal, stated that Portuguese law allows the compulsory quarantine of a patient infected with a virus and even provides for the possibility of declaring a state of calamity, which should be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic.\nOn the contrary, Francis George, who was also Director-General of Health, believes that it will be necessary to make amendments to the Constitution to institute mandatory internment for public health reasons. \"In Portugal, it is time for Members of the Assembly of the Republic to amend Article 27(h) of Article 27(3) of the Constitution in order to allow compulsory admission for reasons of public health. Inevitable,\" wrote Francisco George, in an article of opinion recently released in the public diary.\nCaroline Barnett, a professor of public health at the University of Paris, says the risk of this kind of measure increases with the extent of the problem. \"The problem is when the state seeks mandatory admittance of hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring the proper conditions for all these internments,\" said Barnett to Lusa, referring\nto a scenario that may occur in several countries in the short term.\nFor this specialist, an uncontrolled virus spreading situation can lead to a political pandemonium, with several governments having to recognise the inability to deal with thousands of dead people and health-care systems lacking in the means to welcome millions of infected people.\nIn Europe, the European Commission seeks solutions that are less intrusive than mandatory interbreeding, with mechanisms to isolate the spread of the virus that avoid the need for compulsory interbreeding, in particular by activating the pool. European Civil Protection Organization- an organisation established to expedite coordination of efforts between member countries for rapid disaster response.\nA major political decision in the European Community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. The European Commissioner for Food Health and Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said that the World Health Organisation advised no restrictions in Europe to justify the removal of this solution.\nMr Pedro Teixeira Fernandes recalls that such a measure goes against the very spirit of Schengen, but recognises that an emergency situation can justify it over a short period of time.\nThe governments of Italy and France, whose countries border them, have announced that they are aware of this possibility, after the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto have been heavily affected by the spread of the new coronavirus. Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been criticised by regional authorities for the most relaxed way in which he has addressed the issue of coronavirus, even criticizing local decisions on school closures and other public spaces.\nConte tried to allay fears that his government might not be able to contain the virus after being forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had deficiently treated an infection case, contributing to the spread of Covid-19.\nPolitically, the most delicate border is the one separating Italy from Austria, two countries which are in open confrontation around the discussion of the European budget and which also seem to have different views on how best to contain the coronavirus. The Austrian Government has already indicated that it would like to see the borders better guarded, but the Italian Government has already said that it sees no reason to suspend Schengen by asking the European Commission to quickly release the fund of 232 million euros to contain the spread of Covid-19.\nDiplomatically, the problem is also being used as an excuse to regulate the increasing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. Singapore authorities are blocking the entry of Chinese into the territory after the Minister of Business and Industry of this territory announced that the tourist area was overly dependent on China, using virus protection measures to justify medium- and long-term measures in moderation of their entry.\nTeixeira Fernandes recalls that the Covid-19 case is a serious threat to China's position, an early focus of the epidemic, at a time when it is launching its economic expansion programme, especially towards the United States, with whom it has been waging a trade war for almost two years.\nThe IPRI-Nova specialist also recalls another case of a country in conflict with the United States, Iran, which is also facing a serious problem of spreading the virus, which will also be fragile in the face of its enemies.\n"}, {"content": "Nightmare for us, miracle for the environment? Covid-19 can have significant impacts on CO2 emissions. Months ago, no one, not even Greta Thunberg, would risk drawing up such a radical scenario: that a pandemic could be responsible for the further decrease in carbon dioxide emissions worldwide in the last decade. In other words, that a humanitarian dystopia could become some kind of ecological miracle.\nWith the decrease in oil consumption, the world is emitting less than a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a day. And all this because of Covid-19. The International Energy Agency (EIA) released a report this week indicating that the global demand for oil should be contracted this year for the first time since 2009.\nThere is no doubt that the pandemic is having an impact on the environment. Only in China, where the new coronavirus emerged, there has been a 25% decrease in CO2 emissions in recent months due to the factories closing in Hubei Province. If this trend continues, the Guardian environment editor Jonathan Watts wrote two weeks ago that world emissions may fall to 2008/09 values before the financial crisis.\nEven a drastic reduction in home-work and home-work travel, somewhat across Europe, is not to be taken out of the equation. \"The idea that we need to move every day to a central place to work can be the result of inertia more than anything else. Confronted with the real need to move through the mouse [computer] Instead of the car, we may find that the benefits of job flexibility extend to everything from gasoline consumption to the need for large car parks in offices,\"said U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben to the British diary.\nHowever, while emissions, at industrial and aviation level, are falling sharply, the increase in the energy consumption of quarantine citizens also weighs heavily on the balance of emissions. \"If you come to a cold house and you have to warm it up, it will entail costs that on average will not compensate for the savings of not having to drive to work,\" explained Christopher Jones, a California University climate policy specialist, to Scientific American magazine.\nA coincidence: in 2016, the United Nations determined that the limit that would be imposed on carbon emissions on international flights would be based on the figures recorded in the year of 2020. The expectation was that airlines would continue to grow, and CO2 emissions, of course, would continue to grow, and a ceiling would therefore be established; since 2013, emissions have increased 26%, note that.\nBecause of Covid-19, there were hardly so few airplanes in the air for decades, and the emissions were so low, says the Independent. World air traffic fell 4,3% in February; In China, the number was more radical: 70%.\nThe pandemic caused the average volume of CO2 emissions to drop significantly. The number of aircraft in the air, at least at European level, is minimal. \"A possible beneficial outcome of the virus, if we can se e any light in this tragedy, is that the baseline [determined by the UN] is 2020 and, at the moment, aviation is sort of flat line,\" said Katherine Kramer, responsible for climate change in the Christian Aid association in the British Parliament, this Wednesday.\nIn other words, when it comes to the end of the year, if there is no change in the United Nations calendar, the emission base line will be much lower than expected four years ago, he explained. Remember: aviation is one of the sectors that most contributes to climate change: domestic and international flights in 2018 issued around 895 million tonnes of CO2.\n"}, {"content": "Unlike other countries, Portugal does not impose quarantine on returnees. What are the plans for coronavirus cases?. Unlike several countries, including European ones, Portugal has not provided for automatic quarantine for citizens repatriated because of the coronavirus outbreak, which would be unconstitutional, because it is only provided for psychiatric cases. In Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, the measure is planned, if necessary for 14 days, to incubate the disease until the first symptoms appear.\nIn Spain, for example, El Pais has already advanced that quarantine will be carried out at the Ulla Central Hospital in Madrid, where a full floor is reserved. In the UK, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has already warned: \"Public safety is our priority. Anyone returning from Wuhan will be isolated for four days with all the necessary medical care\".\nAlthough there is no provision for the quarantine to be compulsory, the Health Minister stated this Thursday that the Portuguese to be removed from China will be screened before they start their journey and arrive at the airport. Marta Temido added that Portugal still studies the hypothesis of a containment space, \"whether at home or elsewhere\", which depends on the \"clinical condition of these people and their previous history\".\nThe contingency plan that is set up in three Portuguese hospitals entails personal protective equipment, spaces and means allocated and linkage with INEM for the reception of any contaminated persons, found the Express at the health units.\nAs the epidemic progressed, it was only last week that the Directorate-General for Health designated the hospitals of San Juan in Oporto, and Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon as destinations for potential infected people, and hospitals are responsible only when patients arrive in the hospital unit.\n\"The transport of these patients (suspected or confirmed cases) should be done by INEM, which has the appropriate means,\" explains St John's Hospital. Moreover, the source of the same unit clarifies that only acute disease situations will be addressed. and that hospitals are not expected to be a designated quarantine site for possible patients.\n\"Only patients will be admitted to the institution of the University Hospital Centre of San Juan; we have no information that the repatriation of any Portuguese citizen who is ill is expected\", they say.\nFrom the Curry Cabral in Lisbon, the information is the same. To the Express, Fernando Maltez, Director of the Infectious Diseases Service, it reinforces that the contingency plan already drawn up will apply only to infected people or suspected of infection. \"It includes the isolation of these people in their own rooms in the service of infectious diseases.\" In this sense, \"14 negative pressure respiratory isolations\" were made available, used to house patients with infectious diseases.\nBut as the contingency plan was \"prepared to ensure the safety of both patients and health professionals\", other measures are foreseen, such as the existence of separate \"passing circuits\" and the delivery of \"individual protective equipment\", such as \"coats, gloves, masks, glasses and hats\". Everything is in place, including with regard to the \"treatments and diagnostic methods to be implemented\", says Fernando Maltez.\nIn the case of St. John's Hospital in Oporto, the prevention plan, which will be updated \"according to the knowledge of the evolution of the epidemic\", includes specific physical spaces and means that are allocated to this response. This includes doctors, whose number depends on the amount of \"suspected or confirmed cases\". and their characteristics, in particular whether adults or children and degree of gravity.\"\nAs with Curry Cabral Hospital, the healthcare professionals at the hospital in Porto who provide care for these patients will have to use \"personal protective equipment appropriate to the type and risk of transmission of this agent\", which, depending on the activity to be carried out, will go through the use of \"masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection (glasses or visors).\nAlthough the plan is specific because it is a new virus and therefore has \"its own characteristics\", St John's Hospital admits that there are points of contact with previous diseases such as bird flu or influenza\nA. \"There are, of course, similarities to previous emerging diseases in the way they are transmitted, as has been the evolution of the epidemic and the implications in terms of public health and control measures,\" they admit.\nFernando Maltez adds that the Curry Cabral has already \"activated several contingency plans for other infectious disease threats\" and that these plans \"are being modified and updated\" with changes in personal protective equipment, as with the e bola outbreak that originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \"which is transmitted by contact with any organic fluid\" and not \"respiratory only\", as in the case of coronavirus.\nWith regard to the precautions to be taken, the specialist says that they are the same as in a case of influenza, including for those living with the Portuguese who are to be taken shortly from Wuhan, all indications are that this Friday already, and placed under surveillance at home for a 14-day period, on a case-by-case basis.\n\"These citizens do not need to be alone at home, being able to live with family and friends as long as they wear masks and wash their hands. Those who live with them also have to do the same,\" he said.\nThe coronavirus symptoms ar e similar to those of a flu, but more intense: fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\n"}, {"content": "FOREX-Yen holds gains on virus woes, euro crumbles on weak growth outlook.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept the key interest rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent in what seemed to be a widely expected move.\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das spoke about several issues affecting the Indian economy including negative output gap and shared a fresh growth projection for the next fiscal.\nHe also explained why the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to go forward with an accommodative stance.\nOther than that, the MPC also expressed concerns over inflation and gave a higher projection. But it said it would ensure that inflation remains within its fresh target.\nOn the recent budget announcements, RBI said income tax concessions under the new optional regime will help boost domestic demand and welcomed the government’s infrastructure push.\nShaktikanta Das also admitted that RBI is concerned about the recent developments on global trade due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are some key takeaways from RBI’s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review in 2019-20.\nOutput gap negative\nThough RBI expects private consumption to drive growth in the upcoming fiscal, it says the output gap remains negative in the present scenario due to a mix of domestic and global economic factors. While RBI did not opt for a rate cut, Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank has enough tools at its disposal to act if economy weakens further.\nFY21 growth outlook\nRBI has estimated GDP growth at 6 per cent for 2020-21. For the first six months of the next fiscal, growth has been predicted at 5.6-6.2 per cent while 6.2 per cent rate has been estimated for the third quarter of FY21. RBI’s projection indicates that an economic recovery can be expected by the second half of 2020-21, given there is a steady decline in inflation and other domestic disturbances.\nBudget commentary\nShaktikanta Das said the RBI welcomed decisions taken by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020-21, especially on the tax front and the government’s infrastructure outlay. He said the income tax concessions under the optional income tax rate will boost consumer demand while the infra push was in line with higher rural spending.\nCoronavirus concern \nThe Reserve Bank of India expressed serious concern over the coronavirus outbreak in China with respect to global trade. It said the rapidly spreading virus, which has globally claimed than 500 lives, may even impact India’s economy adversely. However, Governor Das said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is uncertain till now. He also called for a rapid action plan to deal with the growing trade drawbacks due to the outbreak. In India, there are no new cases of coronavirus after three from Kerala were diagnosed positive. But businesses in India are already facing the heat of the outbreak. The diamond industry in Surat says it could lose business up to Rs 8,000 crore as key markets continue to remain shut. Companies from all sectors who import materials from China are also facing the heat.\nInflation projection hiked\nRBI continues to remain worried about inflation, especially since demand for food commodities have increased globally after the coronavirus outbreak. RBI has projected CPI inflation upwards to 6.5 per cent for the present quarter and 5.4 per cent for the first half of FY21, which is expected to go down to 3.21 per cent in the third quarter of FY21. While inflation projection has been increased from the earlier policy review, inflation is expected to come down as a result of falling vegetable prices, especially onions. A better Rabi sowing season may also contain inflation.\nDon’t Discount RBI \nRBI said its policy stance should not be seen as a future policy action and that it has many ways of tackling economic growth when required. Shaktikanta Das said RBI will continue to maintain an accommodative stance, indicating that it will act whenever necessary to beat slowdown. Have many instruments at our disposal to address slowdown, Das said.\nSmall saving schemes interest rates \nThe RBI’s MPC also indicated that there is a need for adjustment in interest rates for small savings schemes. Small savings school include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and others. It remains to be seen whether the government acts on the RBI’s advice.\nGood Rabi sowing\nAnother positive mentioned by the MPC is higher Rabi sowing of 9.5 per cent up to January 31. Production of v\negetables was also estimated to go up by 2.6 per cent, as per the MPC. This is a good indication as it could lead to moderation in the prices of vegetables.\nBetter indicators \nWhile there are some existing factors that need to be addressed, RBI said there has been an improvement in industrial activity. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), prepared by IHS Markit, rose from 52.7 in December 2019 to 55.3 in January 2020. India’s service sector activity also touched a seven-year high in January, indicating a recovery. Apart from all these factors, RBI said private investment is also likely to grow in the next fiscal.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: WHO warns that young people \"are not invincible\".

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\n“CDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,” the statement said. “We had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.”\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have had made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University.\n“The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,”  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since t\nhe training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SINGAPORE - An estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the Wuhan virus will become very ill, such as with more severe pneumonia, says a Singapore infectious diseases expert. \n That is the current estimate and this may change when more is known about the Wuhan coronavirus, also known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), says Dr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n There are currently four confirmed cases of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Singapore. The patients had all travelled from China where the virus is spreading fast. \n With concerns growing, The Straits Times asked Dr Vasoo to explain what else is known about the virus that has so far reportedly killed more than 50 people in China. \n A: In some people, the virus infects the lower respiratory tract (lungs) and this results in pneumonia. Not everyone will get pneumonia but in most diagnosed cases so far, pneumonia, of varying severities, has been commonly described. \n A: As there are currently no proven specific anti-viral medications for the 2019-novel coronavirus, one overcomes the infection with our immune system, and recovers thereafter. \n Not all cases of pneumonia are severe, but most patients who have fared poorly are those who have gone on to develop severe pneumonia. \n Severe cases may have more concurrent chronic medical problems such as cardiovascular disease or lung disease. \n Currently, an estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the 2019-novel coronavirus will become very ill (more severe pneumonia). However, this estimate may change as we learn more about this disease. \n A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever. \n A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus. \n Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death. \n However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore. \n Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection. \n As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common. \n A: You should seek medical attention if you are not feeling well in general, particularly if symptoms have not improved in two to three days. You should seek immediate medical attention if you have risk factors for the 2019-novel coronavirus as described above, so your doctor can assess you. \n A: If you have symptoms you can see your family doctor or polyclinic who will make the initial assessment. \n If more urgent medical attention is needed, or if it is a medical emergency, you should seek medical attention at the nearest emergency clinic or hospital. \n A: Avoid travelling to affected areas, in particular the Hubei province. If you are travelling to China, you should exercise caution and observe good hand hygiene (hand washing or use of hand sanitisers) and avoid crowded places. \n A photo of a man with a mask on at Plaza Singapura MRT on Jan 26, 2020. ST PHOTO: KELLY HUI \n A: As infection by the 2019-novel coronavirus and other common respiratory viruses are spread by respiratory droplets carrying the virus, surgical masks can prevent inhalation of these droplets. \n You should wear a surgical mask if you are ill to prevent spreading whatever respiratory virus you have to others (this is most commonly influenza and the common cold viruses). This is part of being civic conscious. \n Surgical masks may help prevent infection from respiratory viruses in general, if one is around sick people. \n Those who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly or those with poor immune systems, would want to consider wearing them. \n I would discourage the routine use of N95 masks as mask fitting is typically required for its proper use. \n It is also more stuffy and uncomfortable if used for prolonged periods, and may actually be less effective than a surgical mask if used improperly. \n There is no known transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in the community in Singapore at this point, so the routine use\nof a mask to prevent this particular infection is probably unnecessary. \n However, If you are going to an affected area, you should strongly consider the use of a surgical face mask. \n A: This may vary, as patients have developed symptoms as early as in two days while others may develop symptoms later, for example in 10 to 14 days. The average is estimated to be about one week. \n A: You are most likely infectious when you have symptoms, in particular fever and cough.\n"}, {"content": "Malaysian diplomatic missions to continue operations in china - Wisma Putra. PUTRAJAYA, Feb 7  -- Malaysian diplomatic missions in China will continue their operations to provide consular assistance to countrymen and maintain close collaboration with the authorities of the host country.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Wisma Putra) said the cabinet decision to bring home non-essential staff and family members from the Malaysian diplomatic missions in China was made as part of the government’s state of preparedness in its response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic.Wisma Putra in a statement said the decision was also made to minimise risks of exposure of Malaysian staff and their family members to the virus.\"This is certainly expected of any responsible government faced with crisis situation resulting from man-made or natural disasters. It was within this context as well that the repatriation of Malaysians from Wuhan was successfully undertaken recently with the full cooperation from the relevant authorities in China.“In the same spirit, the government may also have to advise other Malaysians to return voluntarily should the situation warrant them to do so while being mindful of the determined efforts of the authorities of China to contain and overcome the epidemic,” it said.It said any efforts by the government would be carried out in close consultation with and cooperation from the Chinese government.\"Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah and State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi held a telephone call on Feb 1, 2020. This close contact will continue to be maintained given the longstanding and very strong ties and partnership between the two countries,\" it said.Wisma Putra asserted that the repatriation of Malaysians should never be regarded as anything beyond what it was actually intended namely, the government’s intention to ensure the welfare of Malaysians. The ministry said Malaysia had stood and would continue to stand in solidarity with the government and people of China. \"Malaysia has every confidence in their preparedness, resilience, and ability to respond effectively to and overcome the current epidemic.  This sentiment too was shared during the telephone call between the two foreign ministers,\" it said.The ministry underscored that Malaysia still kept its doors open to visitors from China when many other countries did otherwise. The only exception was for those from Wuhan and surrounding areas which have been known as the epicentre of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, Wisma Putra said.-- BERNAMA\n"}, {"content": "What is the risk of spreading?\nAfter new evidence of infection with the Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 has become known, the hope of keeping the lung disease out of Germany has been dashed. What is being done to limit the spread and what is known about the virus and the disease?\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), further imports of cases into Germany are expected. Other transmissions of Sars-CoV-2, infection chains and outbreaks in the country were also possible. Local infections could initially remain unknown, said Robert Koch Institute (RKI) Vice President Lars Schaade at RBB on Wednesday. It is \"quite possible that we do not recognise all these outbreaks immediately.\" It is to be expected that this will lead to a further spread. Currently, the risk to the health of the population in Germany is estimated by the experts as low to moderate.\nThe Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently explained that an infection wave in this country could mean, among other things, full waiting areas and medical practices, occupied intensive beds and completely congested health offices. For this reason, the aim was to delay as far as possible the spread of the Coronavirus, such as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). \"We must try with reasonable effort to slow down the spread in order to alleviate an intense strain on the health system,\" said Drosten. \"The number of infections should be extended for as long as possible.\"\nA value, as many other people infect an infected person in the medium, can still not be safely stated. The virus spreads through droplet infection, for example when coughing and speaking. First results indicate that the virus is also spread over the digestive system and at least for a few days over surfaces. A previously underestimated risk was that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19 disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of Sars-CoV-2 could be detected, for example Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectiology and tropical medicine at the Munich clinic Schwabing, explained.\nThis is still a difficult question. For a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease, insufficient data are currently available, says the RKI. According to an analysis recently presented by the Chinese health authority, two,3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. In the case of people over eighty years, the death rate calculated from the data available there is close to fifteen percent, so in this age group in China, the average death rate is about 15 from 100 infected. They die 0.2 percent of the infected, i.e. about two percent of 1000 affected.\nExperts assume that mortality is actually lower than estimated in China, partly because many mild-acting infections are not recorded in Chinese statistics. However, there are no reliable analyses of mortality from other countries so far.\nMost people have only a mild cold symptom with frostbite and sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, fever, cough and breathing problems, as they also occur with a flu. Headaches or diarrhoea are also possible.\nAccording to the Chinese health authority, for more than 80-percent of the infected, mild infections occur, almost 14 percent are severe. For almost five percent, life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure occur.\nThe incubation period, the period between infection and onset of symptoms, is usually two to fourteen days, which is why suspicious cases are isolated for two weeks.\nThere is no special treatment for Covid-19. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the treatment of possible bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\nor antiviral medicines.\nNope. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines such as those for influenza. However, the development of protective vaccination takes a long time. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that the first human vaccine tests could begin in three to four months. However, a certified vaccine for extensive use will probably not be available until 18 months.\nThe US biotech company Moderna reported on Monday that it had developed a vaccine candidate and delivered it to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). According to CNN, its director Anthony Fauci announced the first clinical trials for the end of April. He also expected that it would be one to a half years before a vaccine was available.\nTo protect against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Experts estimate the benefits of normal breathing masks, as currently seen in China and other countries all over the streets, to be rather low. It can help to limit hugs and hand shakes and not touch surfaces touched by many people such as doorknobs, handles and elevator buttons.\nIn principle, it is unclear how long the virus survives on surfaces, says the World Health Organisation. Studies suggested that it would be a few hours or days depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or humidity. The probability that an infected product contaminates with the virus is considered low by the Authority. The risk that a recipient might become infected by a package exposed to different conditions and temperatures during transport was also low.\nImported food and goods such as toys, computers or clothing are also unlikely to be sources of infection, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Experts stress the importance of observing general hygiene rules, i.e. washing your hands regularly.\nPeople who have had contact with an infected person should first report to their health department, regardless of whether symptoms have occurred or not. Travellers from risk areas who have symptoms should consult a doctor after a telephone call with an indication of the journey.\nThe main regulation is the National Infection Protection Act (IfSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health summarises: \"If necessary, important fundamental rights such as the freedom of the person, the freedom of assembly or the inviolability of the apartment, as well as the right to physical integrity may also be restricted. \"Authorities may, according to the Bayreuth State Attorney Stephan Rixen, require blood and skin and mucous membranes to be removed. \"As the law expresses, a professional prohibition could be imposed. For the protection of others, people could also be\"isolated in a suitable hospital or otherwise in an appropriate manner\", the law states.\n"}, {"content": "No weddings, no funerals.

None of them is the worst-case forecast, Laurence Boone, Chief Economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), stressed today, but they vary from \"best\" to \"best\" if the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (at the origin of Covid-19 disease) to be essentially contained to China and to the known focuses, or the most serious, if it extends more globally.\nIn the best-case scenario scenario, completed at the beginning of last week, explained this morning Laurence Boone at a press conference, global economic growth takes a 0,5% (or 200 billion dollars) cut to 2,4% (faced with 2,9% in 2019, which was the same scheduled organizational growth for 2020 last November). In this forecast, the growth will be 3,3% in 2021 (slightly above the 3,1% expected in November) The OECD's chief economist said, estimating the organization that, in this view, all impacts will gradually begin to dilute at the beginning of next year.\nA scenario that cuts world economic growth in 0.5% implies a drop in 4% of domestic demand in China and Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, to which more 2% are added in the second quarter. And, overall, a drop in 10% in markets and non-food raw materials in the first half of 2020, explains the OECD.\nAt this reading, the growth of the euro area will be 0,8% while remaining 1,2% at 2021, downloading from the previous OECD forecast, 1,1%. OECD forecasts are worse for France (grow 0,9% in 2020, in the face of 1,3% in 2019 and in relation to the 1,2% expected in November for this year) and Italy (stagnation at 0% with 0,2% growth in 2019 and a cut in relation to the 0,4% that the OECD had predicted four months ago). For Germany the forecast is 0,3% in 2020, in relation to 0,6% in 2019. In November 2019, the OECD estimated that the German economy would grow 0,4% this year.\nIn China, the forecast growth for 2020 is 4,9%, when in 2019 it was 6,1%. Here, the forecast cut between November and today is 0,8 percentage points.\nIn the worst-case scenario, domin o effect, this is not the worst-case scenario. Laurence Boone stressed this morning that she went around all the direct questions about the possibility of a potential short-term global or country recession, the impact on world GDP will be 1,5% That is, OECD's chief economist recalled \"almost half of the expected [global] economic growth [by the OECD] four months ago\". At that time, as already stated, the forecast was that in 2020 the overall growth would be 2,9%.\nIn this scenario, in addition to the forecast reduction of domestic demand from China in the same order as the \"most optimistic\" scenario, an extension is added to other regions: a decrease in \"more than two% in demand in most Asian-Pacific countries\" and the most developed economies in the northern hemisphere during the second quarter of this year, with a decrease of 20% in the capital market and in the price of non-food raw materials, together with \"an increase of 50-points based on the investment risk premium in all countries\".\nThe OECD is particularly concerned about the'trust shock'in world markets, reflected last week in the main, if not all, squares of Asia, Europe and the USA.\nAnd this, Laurence Boone argued this Monday, \"it is not a shock that can be faced only by central banks.\" The chief economist of the organisation said that dealing with and increasing confidence in the capital market. \"This is not a crisis that can be fought by central banks, but by budgetary authorities.\" Yeah.\nGovernments \"must act now to restrict the advancement of the new coronavirus, protect populations and businesses from its effects and support economic demand\", the organization advises.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n\"There is much that governments can do for people,\" Laurence Boone said while presenting power point to journalists by video conference. And after the \"governments must act now\" page, he listed the possible measures for the general population: \"increase resources for the health sector,\" \"temporarily finance for more vulnerable families,\" \"expand temporary work models.\"\nIn the case of companies, OECD suggestions for world governments to deal with the new coronavirus are \"redu\ntax collection or deferral for the sectors most affected.\" \"increase liquidity and availability of credit to enterprises\", and \"reduce state debts to business.\"\nIn macroeconomic terms, the OECD also leaves a mini-script: \"increasing liquidity to banking\", ensuring that monetary policy has an adequate \"extreme market conditions\" response; \"allow automatic stabilisers to function fully\" and \"increase public investment\".\n"}, {"content": "Chinese public dial in for support as coronavirus takes mental toll. SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of 24-hour mental health support telephone hotlines have sprung up in China in recent weeks as millions of people fret about catching the coronavirus - and try to avoid infection by staying at home.\nMedical professionals welcomed the launch of several official services in a country where mental health remains a relatively taboo subject, but cautioned that unofficial talk lines could do more harm than good.\n“There are a lot of hotlines out there staffed by a lot of volunteers but it just doesn’t make sense because there’s not many that can be well-trained,” said Cui Erjing, a Seattle-based volunteer for one of the hotlines, who is originally from China’s Southern Guangdong province.\n“It can be really traumatising to ask for support but not get the right responses.”\nA survey by the Chinese Psychology Society published by state media last week found that of 18,000 people tested for anxiety related to the coronavirus outbreak, 42.6% registered a positive response. Of 5,000 people evaluated for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 21.5% had obvious symptoms.\nThe hashtag #howtodealwithfeelingveryanxiousathome has been trending on social media platform Weibo, with more than 170 million views, as misinformation about the spread of the disease and travel bans feed public worries.\nThe hotlines are part of the government’s “first level response” for dealing with the psychological impact of major health emergencies, a strategy that was first deployed following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster in which 87,150 people were killed or listed as missing.\nThe National Health Commission said more than 300 hotlines had launched across the country to provide mental health advice related to coronavirus, with support from university psychology departments, counseling services and NGOs.\nThey have been inundated by callers in a country which has just 2.2 psychiatrists available for every 100,000 people, according to WHO data, five times fewer than in the United States.\nA national hotline run by Beijing Normal University was overwhelmed when it went live at the end of January, said Cheng Qi, a Shanghai-based psychologist.\nWhile the number of calls has dropped as other lines opens, the content has become more challenging, Cheng said, noting one caller with chronic depression who had reported suicidal thoughts triggered by the barrage of bad news.\n“It’s not the virus [that caused it], but the virus is stimulating it,” she said.\nXu Wang, a psychotherapist at Tsinghua University, which is working with the official Beijing city hotline, said a major challenge was working out which callers showed real symptoms of the virus and which were instead suffering from anxiety.\n“Callers often have somatic issues, and might say, ‘I can’t eat well, can’t sleep well, and I want to know if it’s a virus infection,’” he said.\nA volunteer group of more than 400 therapists called ‘Yong Xin Kang Yi’, which roughly translates to ‘Use Heart to Fight the Virus’, focuses on helping overworked medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.\n“They leave messages saying they’re exhausted, that they’re scared,” Cui said. “The doctors don’t know if they’re going to get infected or if their co-workers or going to get infected, and they don’t know how bad it’s spreading.”\nMedical researchers from Peking University included telephone and internet counseling for healthcare staff, patients, and the public among six key strategies for coping with mental stress over the coronavirus outbreak.\n“We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate\n2019-nCoV,” the researchers said in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal last week.\nThe government recently issued guidance for the hotlines, saying they should be free, confidential, staffed by volunteers with relevant professional backgrounds and supervised by experienced by experts.\nStill, concerns remain about enforcement.\n“There are many individually initiated helplines and it’s difficult to gain consistent support and supervision,” said Sami Wong, a Beijing-based psychotherapist.\nTsinghua University’s Xu said the very nature of the hotlines added to the challenges, preventing volunteers from gaining much-needed face-to-face experience with people suffering mental health issues.\nWong worried tha\nt untrained volunteers could easily put their foot in their mouth.

Although the newspaper itself openly called for caution and restraint, the debate was not over.\nOn December 16, a new virus was found in a hospital in Wuhan, China, but Beijing did not report to the World Health Organization (who) until December 31. Ten days later, the country released the first message on the Internet entitled \"SARS like virus\", which is the culprit of China's mysterious pneumonia.\nThe text states that 59 people were infected but did not die.

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by US$40 billion (S$54.5 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n \"It's just a mathematical thing,\" McKibbin said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology,\" he said. \"Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan 29 note.

Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n More contagious than Sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n The new virus, which emerged in central China in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across South-east Asia and to North America and Europe. \n \"If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars.\n"}, {"content": "Paris Live Monday 20 January 2020.

Other reports on Thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through March 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in February as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.  \n Financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.  \n \"It's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.  \n Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. They have declined for two straight weeks.  \n Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week.  \n The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.  \n Unadjusted claims for Washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, rose modestly last week.  \n The World Health Organization on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,300. Overall, more than 4,700 people have died from COVID-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.  \n The Fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting.  \n Economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in Treasury yields.  \n The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. Stocks on Wall Street continued to drop, with the Dow Jones Industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of President Donald Trump's decision to suspend travel from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  \n  \n WEAK PRODUCER PRICES  \n The disease originated in China, the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar New Year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. The coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.  \n Companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The United States is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.  \n A separate report on Thursday from global placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas showed as of the morning of March 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. Most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. Transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.  \n The trend could persist, with a third report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3%\nafter gaining 2.1% in January.  \n Economists had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. While the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.  \n In February, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. The decline in goods was the most since September 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.  \n The cost of services dropped 0.3% in February after rebounding 0.7% in January.  \n There were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since April 2009.  \n But the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in January. Portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in January. They could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on Wall Street. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  \n \"There are early signs in PPI that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

SINGAPORE — It has been just about a month since the first case of Covid-19 landed in Singapore, but Ms Patricia Zhuang has already had her pay cut by half, to just under S$1,000.  \n The 37-year-old sales staff at Vivy Boutique, an apparel store at Novena Square, was converted from a full-time employee to a part-time staff as part of her company’s cost-cutting measures.  \n “Now, I’m only earning my pocket money,” said Ms Zhuang.  \n It’s a similar story for Mr Rex Xu, a manager at Ker’s Hair Salon, over at Jurong East.  \n The decline in the number of customers at the hair salon has led to a drop in his commission, resulting in an overall 50 per cent dip in income, said the 32-year-old.  \n “If this continues, we cannot survive. We need to eat and pay rent,” he said.  \n  Ms Patricia Zhuang, who works at a boutique at Novena Square. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY  \n The novel coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan and has now spread to 29 other countries and territories, with Singapore reporting 86 confirmed cases as of Friday (Feb 21).  \n Not only has the virus infected close to 75,000 individuals globally and caused more than 2,000 deaths, mainly in China, it also left a trail of economic casualties.  \n As the authorities in Singapore try to curb the spread of the virus through various measures, such as a travel ban on non-residents who have been to China recently, businesses in the retail and food and beverage (F&B) sectors have borne the brunt of the sharp drop in tourist arrivals and weak consumer spending among Singaporeans.  \n The virus-related blow comes on the back of an already challenging retail environment, which has been buffeted by continuing US-China trade tensions and e-commerce competition.  \n The plight of Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu was not uncommon among retail and F&B employees as TODAY went around eight different locations across the island this past week to find out how businesses in these sectors were coping with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n On Monday, the Trade and Industry Ministry downgraded its 2020 full-year growth forecast for Singapore to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent — with a possible recession — from an initial projection of between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had earlier said that the Covid-19 situation already had a greater impact on the economy compared to when Singapore went through an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) back in 2003, and would likely last longer.  \n A ‘PITIFUL’ SIGHT  \n With travel restrictions imposed on non-residents who have been to China in the last 14 days, it is unsurprising that tourist spots have been hit the hardest.  \n At Chinatown, staff and business owners of several establishments told TODAY that sales had gone down by 80 per cent.  \n “Business has dropped so much that it’s very quiet here, nobody at all during the night time… Everybody here is very worried, it’s very pitiful,” said Ms Kathy Fan, co-owner of Vietnamese restaurant Co Ba Quan, which is located along Chinatown’s Food Street.  \n When TODAY visited the street on a weekday afternoon, it was possible to see one end of the road from the other, lined with rows of empty tables. Tourists were few and far between, with some restaurants serving only one table of customers, or none at all.  \n One elderly worker could be seen dozing off at an empty table. \n Earlier this week, TODAY reported that some Chinese workers, businesses in Singapore — including those in Chinatown — are being shunned, amid discrimination faced by some Chinese nationals here. The discrimination stems from anxiety over Covid-19, which originated in the city of Wuhan in China.    \n  Empty tables at Chinatown, where the outbreak of the coronavirus has hit businesses hard. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n But the retail slump goes beyond that — consumers are also avoiding retailers and F&B outlets elsewhere.  \n At Jewel Changi, sales staff said that business had gone down by as much as 70 per cent. Queues at fast-food outlets Shake Shack and A&W were also visibly shorter.    \n And it is not just retail outlets at tourist spots that have been affected. Businesses in the heartlands from Simei to Jurong East also reported a slump in sales.   \n Mr Kelvin Wai, owner of Evergreen Handphone Shop at Simei, said the tr\navel restrictions had also affected his business as 20 per cent of his customers were Chinese tourists who bought mobile phone SIM cards. He has stopped ordering new stock with business down by 40 per cent.  \n At The Digital Gadgets, a mobile phone accessory outlet at Westgate mall in Jurong East, its manager, Ms Serena Nguyen, said that her company was trying to push for more online sales via e-commerce websites as business had dropped by 50 per cent at the shop.  \n Reports of confirmed Covid-19 cases at Marina Bay Financial Centre, as well as companies’ directive for staff to work from home, have also turned the Marina Bay Link Mall into a “ghost town”, said Ms Lyn Lee, founder of Awfully Chocolate.  \n Sales of her two stores at the Marina Bay area have been particularly affected, she said.  \n When TODAY visited Suntec City around noon on Thursday, there was a decent lunchtime crowd at the restaurants surrounding its iconic Fountain of Wealth. But those located further away were more than half empty.  \n Mr Oscar Apiado, the outlet manager of apparel store The Shirt Bar, said that the mall corridors were “almost empty” after 3pm when the lunchtime crowd dwindled.  \n At Japanese buffet restaurant Kuishin Bo, staff could be seen standing around, tending to only a handful of customers during the lunch hour. \n Its restaurant manager, Ms Chao Jun, said that the place would typically be three-quarters full during lunchtime, but it was not even a quarter-full when TODAY was there.  \n SHORTER OPENING HOURS, STAFF ASKED TO TAKE NO-PAY LEAVE  \n With sales dropping by 80 per cent, Ms Chao said staff had been asked to clear leave as there was no longer the need to have the usual manpower strength of five servers on a weekday.  \n “Now I only plan for two people to work. Even two people also got nothing to do… only standing there waiting for customers,” she said. \n Even restaurants which open only for dinner are facing the same problem. Last Saturday, Mr Marjun de Claro, manager at the House of Peranakan at Outram Park, said that the restaurant did not have a single customer for the whole night.  \n The “zero sales” phenomenon is also happening at retail outlets. Ms Zhuang said that there were several days where the store did not manage one single transaction. There was one particular day where it made a total of S$15 in sales.   \n When TODAY visited apparel store Ns’ Boutique at Square 2 at 2pm on Wednesday, its director Ms Chrislyn Ng said the store had not managed a single sale since it opened at 10.30am.   \n With business down by 30 per cent, Mr Freddy Ng, operations manager of Wang Tian Kitchen at Outram Park, said that his restaurant is now closed on Saturdays. Operating hours on weekdays have also shortened by about two hours.  \n Across the island, several business owners said they have started similar cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of part-time staff, or shortening the working hours of their full-time staff, inevitably affecting the income of these workers.  \n Several workers also voiced fears about losing their jobs if their companies continue to be battered over the next few months.  \n Ms Candy Chen, 47, a sales staff at Just Mobile, a mobile phone accessory store at Nex mall in Serangoon, said her commission had fallen by 30 per cent along with the drop in sales.  \n All three employees of Mr Joe Chen, a director of two apparel stores at Novena Square, have been asked to take turns to go on no-pay leave. As a result, they end up working only three to four days a week.   \n He has applied for them to go for skills upgrading courses on the days that they are not working.  \n  Like other malls across the island, businesses at Novena Square have been affected. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY  \n CONSUMERS STAYING AT HOME  \n With companies activating remote-working arrangements, and more individuals choosing to stay home because of the Covid-19 outbreak, it is not surprising that malls are seeing lower footfall, thus affecting the businesses of retailers and F&B outlets.  \n For Ms Michelle Chin, 49, it is not just the malls she is avoiding. She has also stopped going to her church in Bukit Batok.   \n “When (the virus crisis) first broke out, I said I didn’t want to go church. My kids say, ‘Ma, don’t be paranoid’. But it’s my personal choice… It’s just a precaution,” said the retiree, who had stopped attending church service for the past three Sundays.  \n Some churches and other religious institutions have cancelle\nd or scaled back their regular religious services and holding them online instead, after two Covid-19 clusters were identified at churches. \n Before the outbreak, Ms Chin used to head to Novena Square at least once a day to buy her groceries, and patronised some of the shops in the mall now and then.  \n That has all but stopped with the exception of a weekly grocery run.  \n Even then, it is a real quick run. “The minute I get into the mall, I get to the escalator, buy whatever I need and run back,” said Ms Chin.  \n While work-from-home arrangements naturally mean that F&B establishments in office areas would see a smaller lunch-time crowd, it does not automatically translate to increased sales at outlets in residential estates.  \n To reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, Ms Doreen Yeow started working from home whenever possible even before her workplace made it official.  \n Her lunch now consists of home-cooked food, as the 38-year-old engineer has stopped going to crowded places, such as malls.  \n “I don’t step out of the house at all,” she said. She only left home twice in the past week, once to visit her parents and another time to attend a class.  \n Mr Sean Wei Leong, a 32-year-old risk manager, who also started working from home last week, said he generally avoids crowded areas, such as Orchard Road, although he does head to the suburban malls in Tampines where he lives.  \n SOME LANDLORDS EXTEND A HELPING HAND  \n Amid mounting calls for help from the retail and F&B sectors due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday unveiled two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households during his Budget speech. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars crisis in 2003, and significantly exceeded analysts’ expectations of at least a S$500 million package.  \n Part of the S$5.6 billion package is a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package (SSP) meant for businesses and workers affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n The SSP includes:  \n  A S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme where the Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of local employees, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600, for three months. \n  Flexible rental payments for tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, Housing and Development Board (HDB), Singapore Land Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and Sentosa Development Corporation. \n A waiver of one full-month of rent for tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets. \n A half-month rent waiver for tenants under government agencies, such as HDB.  \n A 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport and commercial properties. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng had said. \n Several property developers, such as CapitaLand, GuocoLand, AsiaMalls and Frasers Property, have said that they will pass on the full savings of the tax rebates to their tenants, in response to TODAY’s queries.  \n Marketing campaigns and free parking for visitors, among other initiatives, have also been introduced by some developers to help their struggling tenants.   \n At Suntec City, for example, tenants facing liquidity issues can tap a recently set up S$5 million fund which provides “short term, low-cost borrowing and quick access to funds for working capital”, said Mr Anthony Yip, deputy chairman of APM Property Management, Suntec City's property manager. \n BUSINESSES SAY THEY NEED MORE HELP   \n On the Budget measures, several businesses told TODAY that they would have preferred more direct help on rental rebates — such as how Jewel Changi is offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its F&B tenants for the months of February and March — instead of leaving it to the landlords’ discretion whether to pass on savings from tax rebates to them.  \n “Savings from the tax rebates are nothing to me… We are talking about occupancy costs (being) as high as 70 to 80 per cent (out of tenants’ total costs) now,” said Mr R Dhinakaran, president of the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA).   \n If developers do not provide a direct rebate on rent, a potential consequence would be the closures of several retailers, causing the malls to be empty, he noted.  \n “What can (the developers) do? They can’t sue everybody who can’t pay rent… (Retailers) will just pull down the shutters and go away… That’s a situation, I hope, will not happen,” Mr Dhinakaran said.\nInstead, a “fair approach” during these challenging times would be to pay the landlord a certain percentage of the tenants’ sales as rent, he suggested.  \n  Some establishments at Jewel Changi Airport have seen a 70 per cent fall in business amid the Covid-19 crisis.​ Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Mr Vincent Tan, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS), echoed Mr Dhinakaran’s sentiments, adding that passing on savings from a tax rebate is “way below” what the association is asking for.  \n “In fact, the 15 per cent rebate (announced during Budget) comes from the Government. The developers (are not going to) sacrifice a single cent,” Mr Tan said.   \n Last week, RAS told the media that it had sent letters to 24 landlords, requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for February, March and April.  \n Awfully Chocolate’s Ms Lee said there was “little” offered in the Budget that would help retailers directly and materially. Recalling how property tax rebates were also part of the Sars relief package back in 2003, she said that landlords then were reluctant to pass on the savings to their tenants. \n “It felt as if a great amount of cajoling had to be done before help was given… Is the same thing going to happen? I can only assume so… So if the Government’s intention is that these tax rebates are passed down to the tenants, then I think they should be given with a set of parameters and directives. Not left to goodwill and best endeavours,” she added. \n Passing on the savings of a tax rebate may also not be as timely as compared to a direct rebate, said Wang Tian Kitchen's Mr Ng.   \n “If for now, I keep paying the same rent, so at the end of the year, the landlord say, ‘I rebate you 15 per cent’. What’s the point? It won’t help already. The thing is already over by then,” he said. \n Some businesses said they were disappointed that unlike the 2003 Sars relief package,  the foreign worker levies were not reduced this time.  \n While Ms Chris Lim, a business partner at children edutainment provider Diggersite, said she knows that the Government’s intention is to encourage companies to hire more locals, her hands, unfortunately, are tied.   \n “Our situation is different. The jobs we have, the locals will not take... (The Government) thinks we should hire locals, but it’s actually not our call,” said Ms Lim, whose business includes a cafe at Suntec City.  \n As her company provides edutainment at company events and conducts field trips for children, she has had to temporarily suspend these weekday services, as the Government has discouraged large-scale public gatherings with the raising of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange.  \n As for Mr Wai, who is renting a space from HDB for his mobile phone accessories shop in Simei, he lamented that the half-month waiver for rental is “very little” and not of much help.  \n However, he said he was looking forward to the possibility of setting up flexible arrangements to pay rent, such as through an instalment plan.  \n A STRUGGLE TO HANG ON  \n With no end in sight to the Covid-19 outbreak yet, and consumers continuing to shun the malls and eateries, businesses are worried about the prospect of closures should the situation drag on longer than expected.  \n Mr Heng has repeatedly assured businesses and households that the Government is watching the situation closely, and it will not hesitate to do more if needed.  \n Mr Chen, the apparel store director, said that he has an emergency fund that would be able to tide him through this crisis for the next six months, at most.  \n “If worst comes to worst, if after six months and we’re still making losses, then we may have to close one of our stores. Instead of two, we would just run one,” he added.  \n Other businesses gave a shorter time frame.  \n For example, Diggersite’s Ms Lim said she may have to take more drastic measures, such as retrenching full-time staff, if things do not improve in three months.  \n Mr Shah Iskandar, owner of South Asian eatery Az Zumar at Outram Park, said he would assess the situation in a month’s time.   \n “If the problem goes beyond end of March, finances will be very tight for us,” he said. He might have to cut short his eatery’s operating hours, which is currently open for 24 hours daily to just 12.  \n That would also mean cutting the number of staff required to sustain the operations, he added.  \n Mr Dhinakaran said most\nretailers would probably be able to hold the fort for only the next two to three months, if things do not get better or if the landlords do not provide substantial rebates in rent.   \n “Suppliers will also chase for money. You have stock in the shop but not sold, doesn’t mean they won’t chase… You have to pay this, pay that, but no sales, how do you pay? Then everybody will put up their hands and say, ‘Sorry cannot pay’. That’s what will happen,” he said.  \n RAS’ Mr Tan said most F&B outlets would be able to sustain business under current conditions for the next three to six months.  \n Professor Lawrence Loh, from the National University of Singapore Business School, called on major developers — the ones with the “deep pockets”— to “demonstrate their social responsibility” and help retailers and F&B outlets struggling to cope with the crisis.  \n He pointed out that the economy this time would not undergo a V-shaped recovery, unlike what happened after Singapore eradicated Sars in July 2003.   \n “It would be more like a flat U-shaped recovery… For this Covid-19 outbreak, it’s expected to be longer. It will simmer on, in dribs and drabs... There will be a persistent effect on retail. And even after the outbreak is officially declared to be over, business will not just recover overnight,” he said.  \n In the meantime, for service staff like Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu, they would need to tighten their belts and watch their spending — setting off a spiral of reduced consumption which would further hit retailers and eateries.  \n “Right now, having a job is not bad already,” said Mr Xu. \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of the article stated that Ns’ Boutique was located at Novena Square.

BEIJING - China’s health commission said on Monday (Jan 20)  that medical workers have been infected by the deadly coronavirus first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, confirming it can be transmitted between people. \n “The current situation is that it is no longer animal to human transmission, but human to human,” said Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan, who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus in 2003 and now heads an expert panel under the health commission. \n He cited a case in Guangdong, where the patient had not been to Wuhan but caught the virus from a family member. Dr Zhong also said 14 medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have been infected by one carrier. \n \"The key to controlling the spread of the disease now is to prevent a super-spreader from emerging,” Dr Zhong, director of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, said. \n Another member of the expert panel, virologist Gao Fu, said: “The virus is changing. The virus is adapting to the environment and adapting to humans.” \n The expert panel warned that the number of infections will increase with the Chinese New Year mass migration. \n The World Health Organisation said on Monday that a key emergency committee would meet this week to discuss the spread of the virus across China after it reached three other Asian countries. \n The Wuhan virus that has killed three people so far has spread to China's financial hub Shanghai with more cases reported elsewhere in the country. \n According to state broadcaster CCTV, new confirmed cases have been found in Beijing and Guangdong, bringing the tally to five and 14 respectively in these two cities as of 6pm local time on Monday, while the figure remains at 198 in Wuhan - unchanged since the last official update earlier at 1pm local time. \n Shanghai, in a separate press release posted on the website of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission on Monday, also reported its first confirmed case. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in China to 218. \n The case in Shanghai, a city with a population of 24.2 million, is a 56-year-old woman from Wuhan in central China's Hubei province. She arrived in Shanghai from Wuhan on Jan 12 and was hospitalised and isolated on Jan 15 after showing symptoms of fever and fatigue. She was confirmed to have been infected by the virus called 2019-nCoV on Monday after testing positive. \n The patient is no longer feverish and her vital signs are stable, said the Shanghai press release. \n CCTV also reported two suspected cases in Sichuan, one in Yunnan, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi and one in Shandong. \n A man wears a mask near the Tiananmen Gate Tower in Beijing, on Jan 20, 2020.

LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n"}, {"content": "covid-19 outbreak expected to last longer than sars and cause greater economic impact, life has to go on: pm lee. SINGAPORE — While it took four months before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was fully eradicated from Singapore back in 2003, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n However, Mr Lee stressed that “life has to go on” and Singaporeans have to continue making a living. \n Speaking to reporters on Friday (Feb 14) after meeting various frontline staff members at Changi Airport, Mr Lee said: “Sars took us from March when we had our first cases, until July before we were declared clear and that was, I think very fast. I expect it not to be so fast this time.” \n As China’s economy is bigger and more interlinked with Singapore and the region compared to the situation in 2003 then, Mr Lee said that the economic impact of the outbreak would be significant as it is a “very intense outbreak”.  \n He added that a recession was “possible” and the economic impact on Singapore so far is already believed to be much more than Sars.  \n Speaking to several frontline staff at Changi Airport, including airline crew and sales personnel at the retail stores, he said that the airport had been “substantially impacted”. \n “The flights are down by a third, the shops here are hard hit, and at the same time the crews have to keep the airport running and stay at their posts and keep Singapore open for business”, he said. \n He said that new developments were happening every day and the Government is making a judgement on what is the right thing to do at each point.  \n “So we have to calibrate and judge as we go on each step, what is the most prudent thing to do. Err on the side of caution, but make a sensible judgment. And that’s what we're trying,” he said.  \n  \n The novel coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and has spread to 28 countries and territories, including Singapore, which confirmed 58 cases as of Thursday — the highest number outside of China. \n However, he added that the higher number of reported cases here is due to Singapore’s size and thorough checks by the health authorities. \n While it is understandable for other countries to issue travel advisories against Singapore, he said that they should not make “knee-jerk” decisions to escalate their warnings to an outright ban just based on the headline numbers. \n It is however a different story for bigger countries, which are made up of 10,000 islands, a large land mass or many rural areas, noted Mr Lee. \n “It is not so easy to track what's happening in that country so the reported cases and the developments, there may be some lag before things become known,” he said. \n These circumstances have to be made known to other countries so that they would have the available facts before deciding whether to issue a travel advisory or even a ban on Singapore. \n “To go beyond (a travel advisory), while we will make our case very clearly to the other countries that ‘This is a real situation, please make a sound scientific and medical judgment. Don't just act on a knee jerk, based on somebody's headline,’” said Mr Lee. \n When asked about more clusters emerging, PM Lee said that this does not yet constitute widespread community transmission as most of these cases are still traceable to a particular source. \n “So we will have to watch the trend,  how the trend goes, whether the numbers go up and also whether the cases are traceable and we can continue to do contact tracing and then squeeze out the clusters one by one,” he said. \n During Mr Lee’s visit at Changi Airport, he also met taxi drivers who were willing to ferry healthcare workers and gave them a care package consisting of hand sanitisers and disinfectant wipes.  \n Separately on Friday, he also penned a Valentine’s Day note to all healthcare workers on the frontline.  \n Posting a photo of his handwritten card on Facebook, he thanked them for looking after patients “day after day”. \n \"Your loving care and commitment makes all the difference. We all stand with you and give you our full support,\" he wrote.  \n  \n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India's response so far holds lessons for other countries | OPINION.

Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure’ model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government’s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

By Melati Mohd AriffThis is a round-up of COVID-19 related matters in Malaysia and globally from Feb 10 to 14.Update as at 5.30pm: Total number of patients who have recovered in Malaysia and Indonesia's first possible COVID-19 case.Kuala Lumpur (Bernama ) -- The number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia remains at 19 today at the time of writing since the first case was reported on Jan 25.Out of the 19 cases, six are Malaysians while the remaining 13 are Chinese citizens.Today, four more patients, all Chinese nationals, in Malaysia were reported to have recovered, bringing the total number of people who have recovered to seven. Today's cases comprised a 65-year-old woman, her daughter-in-law, 36, and two grandchildren aged 11 and two.  The three patients who had recovered earlier, also Chinese nationals, were two men aged 63 and 40 and a four-year-old girl.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad was earlier (on Feb 12) quoted as saying that the spread of the COVID-19 virus infection remained under control and that the country was in the early containment phase.Responding to a statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), he said Malaysia had stepped up its preparations earlier in the event of wider transmission of COVID-19.WHO regional director for the Western Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai told all countries, including Malaysia, to prepare for the possibility of a wider transmission of the COVID-19 virus.He said the region was at a \"critical juncture\" following reports of COVID-19 positive cases with no link to China.Meanwhile, it was reported today that a 19-year-old student from Sifnana village, Tanimbar Islands, Maluku in Indonesia has been quarantined after showing symptoms of COVID-19.The student had reportedly visited Malaysia and will be quarantined for 14 days while awaiting the test results.COVID-19 was previously identified as the Wuhan virus or 2019-nCoV and it was first detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China, on Dec 31, 2019.WHO announced the official name of the virus (COVID-19) on Feb 11 at a news conference at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. COVID-19 is the acronym for coronavirus 2019 – CO stands corona, VI for virus and D for disease.WHO also announced that the first vaccine for COVID-19 could be available in 18 months and stressed that the disease should be seen as \"public enemy number one\".On Feb 11, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to form a joint working committee to address the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively and share information on public health, medication and research.Dr Dzulkefly said the committee would be led by his deputy Dr Lee Boon Chye and Dr Lee's counterpart from Singapore. ADVICE FOR THE PUBLICMeanwhile, the public has been advised not to shake hands but practice the 'Salaam Malaysia' gesture when greeting people to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Dr Lee said the gesture – placing the right hand over the heart area of the chest – would prevent people from touching each other, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus.Despite the stern warning from the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission that action will be taken against those who spread fake news or rumours with regard to COVID-19, police have opened another investigation paper in relation to this matter, bringing the number of such cases to 23 so far.Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (Intelligence and Operations) deputy director Datuk Mohd Roze Shaari said the new investigation paper involved a case in Tumpat, Kelantan.So far three cases have been brought to court, one each in Kuala Lumpur, Terengganu and Sabah. GLOBAL STATISTICS According to the latest statistics taken from the Ministry of Health's website, the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide currently stands at 64,267 covering 25 countries and the total number of deaths 1,489.  Reuters reported yesterday that China's Hubei province recorded 242 deaths on Wednesday (Feb 12), so far the highest number of deaths reported in a single day. Hubei's Health Commission also reported 14,840 new COVID-19 positive cases on the same day.Apart from one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines that occurred last week, Japan announced one death yesterday. The Japan Times quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cas\nes of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February, have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan, others in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore 58 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany 16, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11. Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine yesterday after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019. On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003. Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA \r\n    \r\n \n"}, {"content": "China reports new virus cases, raising concern globally before key holiday.

Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well.\nBut Alexandra Phelan, global health legal expert at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said such screening may be insufficient in preventing the virus from spreading as its symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, are “quite general”.\n“There are likely to be many individuals with matching symptoms due to an illness that is not 2019-nCoV,” Phelan said, referring to the new virus.\n"}, {"content": "u.s. cdc reports 68,440 coronavirus cases, 994 deaths.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading COVID-19 without knowing they are sick.\nAs the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. The border of Hubei province, epicenter of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.\nBut there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.\nAsymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.\nIn China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.\nChina had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.\nAsymptomatic cases are currently found through “contact tracing”. China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms.\n“Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,” said Wu Zunyou of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. “So will they be able to create transmission? They won’t.”\nStill, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing’s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control.\nDespite recording zero new infections from March 18 to March 22, the COVID-19 hotspot city of Wuhan disclosed on March 20 that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year old man surnamed Zhang had shown no symptoms.\nCiting hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient.\nChina says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage.     But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.\nSome experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.\n“It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.\nIt is also unclear how much they might infect others.\n“We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that’s a major driver of transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.\nNew studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks.

Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.\nThe Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.\n“The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,” said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.\n"}, {"content": "China's GP postponed due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus.

SINGAPORE — With Singapore’s blood banks closely watching the screening of donors during the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities are appealing for healthy donors to give blood because stocks have dipped to low or critical levels. \n In response to TODAY’s enquiries on Friday (Feb 14), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which manages Singapore’s blood banks, said: “Our blood stocks are currently trending downwards. We, therefore, strongly urge donors who are healthy and eligible to step forward as our patients really need your support during this challenging period.” \n With extra precautions in place, such as stringent screening of donors before they are allowed into the blood banks, HSA said that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, while giving blood is assessed to be low. \n The Singapore Red Cross said on its website that on Friday, stocks for the A+, B+, O+ and AB+ blood types were at “critical” levels, and those for the A-, B-, O- and AB- blood types were “low”. \n When blood stocks are at the critical level, this means that donors are urgently needed and urged to donate on the same day. \n For blood types where stocks are low, donors are urged to donate within the week. \n HSA said that blood is needed every day to support the needs of patients in Singapore, and that it was important to maintain at least six days of blood stock at all times for daily transfusion needs and bleeding emergencies. \n Last year, there were 75,655 blood donors, or just 1.87 per cent of the resident population. \n NO EVIDENCE CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH BLOOD \n For now, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted through blood, HSA said. \n Even so, the authority has put in place a slew of measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply and the health of its donors. \n Since last Friday — when Singapore raised its disease outbreak response code to Orange — HSA has been screening potential donors and their companions for fever or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose, and their travels to mainland China, before they can enter the blood banks or mobile donation drives.   \n Those who are unwell, on leave of absence or have been to China in the last 14 days will be barred entry. \n Apart from beefing up the screening of donors, HSA said that staff members were monitoring their temperatures twice daily, and have been told to wear masks and see a doctor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. \n “To further assure our donors, we have also increased the frequency of cleaning to ensure the cleanliness standards of our blood banks,” HSA added. \n INFECTED DONORS TO BE DEFERRED \n As for donors who have Covid-19 infection, their donations will be deferred until more information becomes available, HSA said. \n “They will only be allowed to donate blood when there is more medical data to indicate when it is safe for donors who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection to donate blood again,” it added. \n Blood donors told TODAY that they would continue to give blood, although one donor is concerned about visiting the blood banks. \n Undergraduate Tan Hui Lin, 24, who last donated blood in 2018, said that the blood banks are in areas where people tend to congregate. \n HSA’s four blood banks are in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands and Jurong East. \n “Most of us would avoid crowded places… there’s high inertia to actually leave the house,” Ms Tan said, although she added that she would donate blood if the supply is low. \n Mr Shahroull Khairoullah, 29, a painting company owner who gives blood every three months, said that he would not do so for now because he has been coughing for the past few weeks. \n Business development manager Chan Si Yong, 27, said that HSA’s added precautions were helpful, even though screening procedures were already stringent before the virus outbreak. \n Donors have to fill in a health questionnaire and be checked by a medical screener, he said. “If you are unwell, they will turn you down.” \n Public servant Andrew Wilfred, 33, said that the coronavirus outbreak would not deter him from donating blood. \n “I trust that the nurses are doing their best to maintain the high standards of hygiene that they have always done.” \n For information on where to go for blood donation and the blood banks' opening hours, go to HSA's website or the Singapore Red Cross' website.\n"}, {"content": "Association ensures that gyms are \"ready\" for coronavirus outbreak.

SINGAPORE — A person’s physical and mental health get messed up on a regular basis when he or she travels frequently for work, and the latest coronavirus epidemic is not helping matters presently. \n Mental health issues are predicted to be one of the top 10 risks that business travellers will face this year. This is based on the latest Travel Risks Outlook 2020 report by global travel risk management company International SOS. \n Yet, these issues remain an overlooked aspect of business travel, especially in today’s hypermobile work climate. \n Dr Low Kiang Wei, medical director of International SOS, said that not only does business travel take a toll on physical health, it also affects individuals on a psychological level due to factors such as time spent apart from loved ones, blurred lines between work and after-work hours, and anxiety due to unexpected increases in workload. \n Navigating travel risks such as natural disasters or epidemics can add on to the stress. \n Infectious diseases outbreaks are also one of the risks highlighted in International SOS’ report. \n So far, health officials in China have confirmed more than 31,000 cases of the new coronavirus, with more than 4,800 of them considered severe. The disease, which causes pneumonia in its severe form, has claimed the lives of more than 630 people in China. \n The virus, also known as 2019-nCov, has also sickened more than 200 people in at least 20 countries. In Singapore, two patients who are warded are under intensive care. \n Dr Low said of the anxiety that travellers face: “Without appropriate pre-trip awareness, risk mitigation advice, access to 24/7 assistance in case of emergencies such as natural disasters or epidemics, business travellers can also feel unnecessarily stressed about their own safety.” \n Even with the appropriate preparations, an evolving and escalating situation such as the current coronavirus epidemic can considerably increase a traveller’s stress, he added. \n “There is an element of the unknown and situations can change quickly. \n “In these circumstances, it is important to provide access to timely, accurate, verified information. Travellers and assignees can also feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable,” Dr Low said. \n Dr Edwin Ong, resident doctor at DTAP Clinic in Siglap, said that stress and anxiety levels can rise when faced with the increased possibility of close contact and exposure to infected travellers, especially when heading to countries that have confirmed the presence of the virus. \n “Business travellers may feel that they are putting their health and well-being at risk by having to travel during this unsafe period, and this could weigh down tremendously on their overall mental health,” he said. \n WHAT BUSINESS CLIENTS ARE ASKING \n Ms Wynne Wee, vice-president of Asia Pacific at Workplace Options, which provides employee wellbeing solutions, said that her team has received “a significant number” of requests from companies, partners and individuals in the Asia-Pacific region seeking support during this period. \n However, she added it is too soon to ascertain if the increase in calls is specifically due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n Ms Wee said that clients in the management level who ask for support are concerned about how they can support their teams sensitively in these times while maintaining healthy business outcomes. \n Ms Wee, who is a trained counselling psychologist, said: “As with everyone else, the same fears (about the new coronavirus) holds true for business travellers, but we can imagine how this fear may be elevated for those who are still required to continue with essential business travel. \n “On the other hand, if they’re told that travel is put off, this will also have an impact on how one feels about their job security which leads to different concerns.” \n WHAT ONE BUSINESS TRAVELLER IS DOING \n For one frequent flier from Singapore, Ms Syahidah Y, she has greater freedom as the founder of makeup brand Molly Cosmetics to adjust her business travel plans. \n With no obvious end in sight to the outbreak, she has made a self-imposed “semi travel ban” and will limit her business travels to just Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Myanmar. \n Otherwise, she also usually flies to China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan for work at least twice a month. \n Her hectic business travel schedules often leave her feeling we\nary and fatigued.  \n “Work travel is not as glamorous as people make it out to be,” she said. \n “Sure, there are the comforts of travelling in business (class) or staying in fancy hotels, but in reality, the need to be in ‘work mode’ once you get off the plane, constantly be on your toes and be expected to perform your best for work activities — these affect you mentally.” \n It can also get lonely, she added. “There’s limited time in a day. After dealing with work during your travel, you don’t have much time to ‘enjoy’.”  \n HOW WORK TRAVEL MESSES WITH THE MIND \n Dr Ong of DTAP clinic said that the mind and body are interdependent, and neither aspect of health should be ignored. \n “Often times, a much stronger emphasis is placed on physical health instead, such as sleep interruptions from jet lag, unhealthy eating and drinking and lack of exercise. \n “However, if left undiagnosed and untreated, mental health issues can fester and worsen in severity, which in turn lead to the very same physical health issues that we are trying to avoid.” \n For instance, long distance or frequent travel affects the body’s natural circadian rhythm, which is responsible for regulating sleep patterns. \n Poor or little sleep in turn causes increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to the development or worsening of mental illness such as depression or anxiety, Dr Ong said. \n In a separate 2018 study, commissioned by the International SOS Foundation, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and heightened anxiety were reported in a large proportion of international business travellers. \n Almost half, or 45 per cent, of the respondents, reported an increase in stress levels. About a quarter reported heightened depression (27 per cent) and heightened anxiety (23 per cent). \n About 31 per cent experienced emotional exhaustion — a core feature of burnout — on a weekly basis, while 41 per cent reported that their mood suffers during business trips, Dr Low said. \n Dr Ong warned that unaddressed mental health issues as a result of work travel can create a ripple effect on other aspects of the person’s life, such as work performance, relationships and social life. \n There are consequences on a larger scale, too. \n HOW IT AFFECTS BUSINESS COSTS \n “Medical claims for mental and physical health issues lead to increased costs for employers. Reduced work performance, absence from work and short-term disability can result in decreased revenue,” Dr Ong said. \n Yet, Dr Low pointed out that only 15 per cent of organisations surveyed in market research company Ipsos Mori’s Business Resilience Trends 2020 include mental health issues in their travel policies. \n He said: “This figure is worrying, given that there are increasing studies and accounts of business travellers suffering from mental health issues. \n “Business travel is likely to continue in the coming year, and it is important for businesses to build a holistic and preventive culture of health to protect the wellbeing of their workforce.”  \n WHAT COMPANIES CAN DO \n Dr Low said that efforts to address mental health in the workplace need to begin at the C-suite, or management level, and trickle down to the frontline employee. \n International SOS, for example, has in place a range of employee mental health initiatives. It includes the use of an assistance mobile application for employees to receive updates on destination risks as well as briefings on their travel destination, if required from the medical and security teams. \n This has been especially useful in the current coronavirus outbreak situation. \n “Travellers are able to ‘check in’ (via the app) to let their employer know where they are, and to allow monitoring of travel patterns. It also allows tailored advice based on their travel to be proactively pushed out,” Dr Low said. \n “For example, a traveller can be alerted to review or change their routing based on alerts or messages being pushed out. \n “Managers can also review daily travel patterns to proactively push out information to their staff. As this (2019-nCov) crisis has evolved, so has our health information — it’s key that travellers have access to the very latest guidance to help allay their concerns.” \n  Having updated and useful information at hand can help take away some of the anxiety that travellers have. Photo: Media Raw Stock \n From this month onwards, International SOS employees in Singapore will also be able to dial in to a helpline for professional counsel\nling or talk about their emotional concerns. This phone service, done in partnership with Workplace Options, is now in operation in its China and Europe offices. \n Workplace Options recommends that all companies assess their employee’s fitness and suitability for business travel before giving out work travel assignments. \n Ms Wee said: “Not everyone is cut out for business travel, which can take a huge toll on (a person’s mental health). Having the right fitness, mindset and resilience is important to ensure wellbeing and effective outcomes of business travel.” \n Dr Low said other practices that organisations can put in place to protect their employees’ mental health include: \n 1. Having mental health monitoring aside from physical health checks before and after travels \n Ensure that any post-trip feedback surveys include not just logistics, but feedback on mental health and psychological experience. \n 2. Build an organisational restitution culture \n Encourage business travellers to build rest and recovery into their schedule while on the trip and after returning. Enable flexible work schedules for recovery; this may include working from home or taking prolonged weekends. \n 3. Consider adding employee assistance programmes \n This may include 24/7 access to at least telephonic emotional support, and wellness programmes. \n 4. Make the trips as seamless as possible \n For instance, if they encounter a health or medical issue while overseas and late at night, do they know who to easily call or visit for immediate help?\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus pandemic: How the world has dealt with Covid-19, could it have done better?. It looks like a world war against a virus. The novel coronavirus which has acquired pandemic scale both in its spread and declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than China, the source region.\nThe total number of Covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with China accounting for less than 82,000, according to WHO's latest report. While the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. Only 29 of these were reported from China.\nThe WHO has already declared Europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. Incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to Europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. Here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic.\nINSULATION\nThe United States has suspended all flights from Europe. President Donald Trump is expected to declare national emergency. Many European countries such as Germany, France and Britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. This method has worked for many less developed countries such as Magnolia, which is surrounded by China from three sides, North Korea, located like cheese between the slices of South Korea and China, two of the worst affected countries in the world.\nIndia too imposed massive travel restrictions. India began screening of passengers coming to India in the final week of February. The vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. The government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in India at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries.\nIn nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of Covid-19.\nCovid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration of the WHO. However, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion.\nChina called for international cooperation in early February. The WHO too called for a concerted global effort. But all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread.\nWhen the Donald Trump administration suspended flight operations from Europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. Italy, Iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of Covid-19.\nIndia, however, showed some initiative recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the Saarc. Decision was taken to create a Saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. Such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent.\nAnother tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. It began with China.\nFor first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to November 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-December 2019 -- China refused to acknowledge the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the Chinese government. The first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for \"rumour mongering\".\nLater, that doctor died. Chinese media said he died of Covid-19. This all happened despite Chinese President Xi Jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. Recently, an old aide of Xi Jinping went missing after he criticised the Chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic.\nA pattern of cover-up was also seen in Italy and Iran, the two worst affected countries outside the source zone in China-Hong Kong-South Korea. Italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. They responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. The health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. Same has been the case with Iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions.\nIn India, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was in stupor\nas coronavirus caused havoc in the country. This was an allegation of cover up. Though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. The government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country.\nCoronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. In equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. The full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced.\nThe US Federal Reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure.\nThe UK has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. Germany has announced tax cuts. Australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown.\nItaly announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. The European Commission followed the similar suit. Iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on Indian businesses. The RBI has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep less pressure on the banking staff.\n"}, {"content": "Turn it over. The new outbreak of coronavirus has surprised China's top leaders, who are touring the provinces. This warning inevitably changed his agenda, and millions of Chinese are busy enjoying their most precious holidays. The outbreak of pneumonia is still in its early stage, and people's concerns about its development are understandable. In the year of the rat, will the new coronavirus become a rat trap of the Communist Party of China?\nThe Chinese Communist Party has controlled the crisis. First, the central political and Legal Affairs Committee warned party and government officials not to try to cover up the seriousness of the situation. After the SARS crisis in 2003, people realized that opacity was a major mistake and would only exacerbate the problem. Timely, accurate and transparent information seems to have become the standard in this case. Subsequently, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau listed the control of the new coronavirus as the highest priority of any other issue.\nIn a developing country with a death toll of nearly 100000, facing the public health challenges brought by such a serious crisis, the Communist Party of China is also facing political challenges. Maintaining social stability remains a priority. After the initial confusion, some people criticized the initial slow response. The authorities took unprecedented and forceful action quickly and ruthlessly, putting them in trouble. At least for now.\nThe Communist Party of China has no choice but to tighten its muscles and prove itself invincible. Far from being shocking, this slogan aims to reverse the crisis and make it a clear sign of its ability to meet the most serious challenges, whatever they are. This is a message to Chinese society and the rest of the world, including in the field of science, showing the ability and ability to quickly find answers in another possible and impossible period. Xi Jinping said that China cannot compare with the West in many aspects, but it has hoped that the West will be able to deal with such a serious crisis. This belief encourages the Communist Party of China to move forward at this difficult time. This is the call for this nationalism. This nationalism is united, but we can't ignore that this is the second time. There can't be a third.\nThis year is an important year for the Communist Party of China. In 2021, it will celebrate its 100th anniversary. I want to introduce a national magazine to the world. His greatest wish is to announce to the four parties that he has succeeded in making China a prosperous and rich society and a respected country in the world. But much depends on how you get out of trouble.\nXu Rios is director of the China political observatory.\n"}, {"content": "Family says that Portuguese state of health held in quarantine in Japan has worsened.

Hong Kong citizens who have visited the mainland are meant to stay at home while non residents must remain in their hotel or in government isolation centers.\nTravel restrictions and other efforts to contain the virus have added to economic strains brought on by months of protests, with tourist arrivals plummeting and residents staying away from shops at a time when the city is mired in its first recession in a decade.\n"}, {"content": "China accused the United States of creating panic at a time when the stock market plunged. The growing threat of Wuhan coronavirus epidemic has become one of the new friction factors in the complex relationship between China and the United States. Beijing has made it clear that it is disturbed by Washington's response to the biggest disaster experienced by the Asian country in years. Chinese government President Xi Jinping said that measures such as suspending flights or rejecting passengers from China would only \"create and spread fear\".\nThis is the second time in just three days that the Chinese government has made it clear that it is angry at China's overreaction as the largest power. On Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying criticized Washington at an online press conference, in addition to shooting in the global competition to close borders and air traffic, He has not provided any substantive assistance to China.\nThe epidemic in China is far from being controlled. According to figures released earlier on Tuesday, the death toll has reached 425, more than 348 people who left SARS in 2003. The number of infected people has exceeded 19000, of which at least 2296 are in serious condition.\nChina's national reform and Development Commission acknowledged on Monday that this would have a serious negative impact on China's economy, especially the consumer industry.

Both Beijing and Chinese citizens were hopeful, and the official media were enthusiastically reporting. According to the National Health Commission, 477 rehabilitated people had exceeded the dead since the end of this week. The outbreak in the province has also decreased in the past two days, which may indicate that the severe measures taken by the central government have come into effect.\nFrom their point of view, the trade and technology war was suspended after the signing of the first phase agreement in December, persuading the Xi Jinping government to start a new \"cold war\" Washington's ultimate goal is to stop China's prosperity. Beijing now interprets the U.S. behavior in the epidemic as another attempt to weaken it. The White House responded that the U.S. behavior is for public health reasons.\nIn a globalized world, the destinies of all countries are closely linked. In the face of the public health crisis, all countries should work together to overcome difficulties, rather than plunging their neighbors into poverty, let alone taking advantage of each other's difficulties.

The economic impact of the crisis and the issues that Chinese leaders need to pay attention to may complicate Beijing's commitment to significantly increase imports of agricultural products and energy.

The previous balance pointed to 80 dead and more than 2.700 infected.\n\"From the outset, the Chinese Government has shown openness, transparency and responsibility for disseminating information about the outbreak as quickly as possible,\" Xi Jinping stressed.\nXi Jinping's statements come at a time when many Chinese have denounced a late reaction by the authorities to the new coronavirus, but have also been critical of media behaviour.\nWhen the first cases of infection arose, the Chinese media accused the Internet users of spreading \"rumors\" about a potential outbreak.\nWhen the WHO decreed, between 2002 and 2003, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was also detected on Chinese territory, the international organisation strongly criticised Beijing for taking the time to alert and for trying to conceal the extent of the problem.\nSARS killed 774 people in the world, of whom 648 in Chinese territory.\nThe Chinese authorities, which have already admitted that the ability to spread the new virus has increased, have enacted drastic travel restrictions across the country to try to contain the spread of the outbreak, As well as announcing the record-time construction of hospitals in Wuhan and a strengthening of 6.000 doctors for the epicenter province of the coronavirus.\nAlongside these measures, which according to international agencies show a change of attitude on the part of the Chinese authorities compared to the SARS crisis, the city of Wuhan has been quarantined and isolated from the world since last Thursday.\nAlready on the WHO side, and in connection with the meeting between Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Xi Jinping, the spokesman for the international organisation, Christian Lindmeier, said in Geneva that the two officials looked into the possible withdrawal of foreign citizens from Chinese cities, notably Wuhan, scenario being considered by several countries, including Portugal.\nThe two representatives also examined the measures to be taken to prevent these repatriations from contributing to the spread of the virus.\nAlso on the visit of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to Beijing, the spokesman said that the Director-General of the WHO also met the Chinese Ministers for Health and Foreign Affairs, Ma Xiaowei and Wang Yi respectively.\nAt the press conference in Geneva, Christian Lindmeier stressed that the rapid increase in cases of infection does not, at this time, give any grounds for re-convening the WHO emergency committee to assess any possible international emergency declaration.\n\"Three criteria are needed: this is an extraordinary event, which poses a risk of rapid expansion in other countries and requires a coordinated international response,\" said Christian Lindmeier, indicating that although no global alert has been issued, there is already a coordinated response across the world.\nIn addition to mainland China, cases of infection with the new coronavirus have also been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Germany, Australia and Canada.\n"}, {"content": "China's symptom-free coronavirus carriers raise fears of new wave of infections. SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.\n"}, {"content": "Oil prices rise more than 1%, on course for weekly gain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as “100 percent wrong,” without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency’s presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese governme\nnt’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had s\nerved as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nTrump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC’S cut as a matter of politics.\n“Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they’re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing’s cover-up.”\n"}, {"content": "China's Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged, begins to lift its lockdown. WUHAN, China (Reuters) - The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, began lifting a two-month lockdown on Saturday by restarting some metro services and reopening borders, allowing some semblance of normality to return and families to reunite.\nAfter being cut-off from the rest of the country for two months, the reopening of Wuhan, where the epidemic first erupted in late December, marks a turning point in China’s fight against the virus, though the contagion has since spread to over 200 countries.\nAmong those on the first high-speed trains allowed into the city on Saturday morning was Guo Liangkai, a 19-year-old student whose one-month work stint in Shanghai stretched to three months due to the clamp down on movement.\n“It makes me very happy that I can see my family,” Guo told Reuters after being greeted by his mother at the main station.\n“We wanted to hug but now is a special period so we can’t hug or take any actions like these.”\nAuthorities took draconian measures to stop people from entering or leaving the industrial city of 11 million people in central China.

It at least shows that China is victorious,” said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.\nChina’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. Mainland China now has 81,394 cases, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.\nWuhan accounts for about 60% of China’s coronavirus cases, but they have fallen sharply in recent weeks, a sign that the measures are working. The last confirmed locally transmitted case of the virus in Wuhan was on Monday.\nWith the United States, Italy and Spain and other countries now battling soaring infections, China is focusing on the risk posed by imported cases - most of them Chinese returning home.\nEffective Saturday, China suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.\nBut even with the decline in cases and loosening of restrictions, Wuhan authorities were taking few chances.\nStaff, some in full-body protective gear, and volunteers bustled around the railway station in the morning, setting out hand disinfectant and putting up signs reminding travelers they need a mobile-phone based health code to take public transport.\nA worker walked through one metro train carrying a signboard reading: “Wear a mask for the entire journey, people should not gather and when you disembark please scan the health code.”\n“Everyone is taking the right precautions. So, there shouldn’t be a problem,” Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. “But you have to be careful.”\nThe existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.\nLife in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain. Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.\nSome people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.\nHer grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since. With schools there possibly reopening, she hopes he can get back soon.\n“He was supposed to leave on the fifth day (of the holiday) but has now been here for a few months,” she said.\n"}, {"content": "Who ruled out declaring coronavirus an international emergency.

The delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish, said the sources.\nThey said relief and evacuation flights from other countries including by France are allowed to operate by China but the permission has not come through in India's case.\n\"Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support? Why are they creating roadblock in evacuating our nationals from Wuhan and putting them under hardship and mental agony?\" said a person aware of the issue.\n"}, {"content": "Passengers from Japan, S Korea to also be screened at airports.

There is a new virus in the world. We are all asking ourselves the same question: when will it approach us? Ncov (abbreviation for new coronavirus) was born in a remote area thousands of kilometers away from Latin America: according to a detailed study, no city is the most visited city in China's affected provinces. However, Google's search for \"coronavirus\" has surged in recent days.\nIn all cases, the alert is for suspicious cases. The media and viewers are chasing the Latin American patient No. 0 of ncov. We have ruled out some possibilities: one in Tamaulipas, one in Cali, another in northern Argentina, and several in Brazil. This will happen sooner or later. Everything is going so fast that when you read these lines, you may have made the headlines in the newspaper. But what exactly does that mean? What does this mean for the region, a little-known import of respiratory viruses?\nIf our brain defines risk in a dramatic way, it will better perceive risk. We need a character (disease) and a dramatic change in the process of events (daily life) to be vigilant. But the disease rarely follows Hollywood scripts, even though we try to put it in the story. Take influenza A (swine) born in Mexico in April 2009 as an example. From week to week, the attention of this country (and the whole world) is focused on four characters: H1N1. A sense of urgency is quickly infected, like an electrical pulse, such as in Google search. But the evolution of the epidemic itself is much more gradual.\nMore importantly, the scientific team is gradually extracting the actual total impact of the virus and implementing the necessary containment and response measures. Finally, this is an infectious disease. Yes, it is very dangerous for young people (influenza usually mainly affects people over the age of 65). But it did not bring the death disaster we want to dramatize in our minds: according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates, H1N1 claimed roughly the same human lives as seasonal influenza and was lower than other epidemics in the past.\nHowever, our brains are still committed to finding drama, whether in seemingly cold numbers. One of these numbers has attracted attention to ncov on social media, called R0: the average number of people infected from another person who has been infected with the disease. We have just experienced a few weeks of epidemic, and several epidemiologists have come up with their estimates. Some people grabbed the higher figure and sounded the alarm again with the message that \"every person affected by coronavirus will infect three people\". But the fact is that these estimates are quite variable. They always do this: even for known diseases, the value of R0 will change greatly according to research.\nThis is almost abnormal: after all, the behavior of a disease may vary greatly according to the social background in which it occurs. Where there is no sanitation and high population density, the outbreak of the virus will be different from that in sparsely populated rural areas. This is why even the most infectious diseases, such as measles, provide a very wide range of transmission. In addition, let's not forget that the average may be misleading: if the transmission value of ncov in China is found to be 2, then this figure is consistent with the idea that 1000 infected people spread the virus to 2 people per person. Just like the extreme situation of 10 \"super infected people\", each person affects 50 people (because their work has brought them into contact with many people, because they have not been isolated, or for other reasons) Although the first case can guarantee exponential infection, in the second case, once the conditions conducive to large-scale transmission are determined, the control of the virus will be much simpler.\nWe do not know that this will determine when and how ncov will arrive in Latin America.\nIn fact, what these figures tell us is that uncertainty is inevitable when we talk about epidemics. In fact, drama is a way to reduce it: if we have a clear enemy, fear becomes certainty. But it is this bias that makes us underestimate or ignore the risks we are used to. Even if they suffered a worrying rebound.\nFor example, let's talk about measles. In 2016, there were fewer than 100 cases on the American continent. Two years later, this figure increased 160 fold: according to who, there were about 16000 people, most of them in Brazil. In 2019, Sao Paulo recorded the first death from this disease in 20 years. The lack of comprehensive and effective vaccination is the main reason.\nMalaria is transmitted through mosquitoes in some tropical areas and is the return of another enemy that has never completely disappeared. But here, the burden of the rebound falls on Venezuela, which accounted for more than half of all cases in 2017.\nInterestingly, although these two diseases attracted disproportionate attention in their respective countries in the second half of 2019, in Brazil and Venezuela (measured by Google search), these two diseases quickly turned to coronavirus in early 2020, which confirmed that nothing can surpass a good disease, A new story of fear and uncertainty.\nTherefore, although our attention follows a different logic, and some diseases have greatly reduced or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), the numbers of other diseases are similar (tuberculosis: about 280000 cases per year throughout the Americas in the 21st century), or, As mentioned earlier, they have even restored lost land. When looking for the reason, there is no simple answer. Mosquito borne diseases are a good example. Some Venezuelan doctors complain that there is no state led spraying, which used to be a means to eliminate malaria. But fumigation is not everything: as the Journal of the National Institute of Columbia Health asked in the editorial of El Zika (another bitten virus) in Colombia and Brazil in March 2016, how effective fumigation is in unsanitary places (water pipes, garbage collection) least? Victor Olano, director of the Institute of health and environment of Forest University, pointed out in a subsequent publication that it is necessary to ensure the minimum coverage in rural areas as the first line of defense against yellow fever, another disease on the African continent.\nWe can also think about ncov similarly: Although all media attention may focus on the design of new drugs and basic proliferation control measures (early detection of cases and corresponding isolation) Maintaining a healthy immune system is the most effective but unobtrusive strategy. Similarly, the best way to prevent the spread of the epidemic is to implement the sanitary protocol on human treatment of animals, and the public authorities have a lot to say and do.\nThe war against epidemics is by no means a dramatic battle for the fate of mankind. Ncov will not be the same as H1N1 (although reduced, it is still among us).\nThe moral of this story is that, as Hans Rosling, a Swedish communication doctor, said, we must curb our desire for drama and refocus our attention, efforts and dedication on what really has a positive impact. Research and international response mechanisms are our best partners in infectious diseases, vaccines, health programmes and infrastructure. Although the first two points will help us fight known diseases, supranational research and capacity are particularly important when we face new diseases. Recognizing this, the World Health Organization agreed on a rule reference framework\nThe international school was established in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region and around the world. Who measures the extent to which each country implements these regulations every year.\nAlthough there are significant differences in the region, there is considerable consistency. There are some worrisome problems in preparation, and some countries obviously lag behind others. In addition, it must be noted that these who figures do not measure the quality and effectiveness of local health systems. For example, given the deterioration of Venezuela's facilities in the crisis in recent years, Venezuela's score will be much lower than that of other countries. These data show that on paper, the African continent has many governance tools needed to respond to new epidemics. However, we can only wait to know what their exact translation is.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 3-China's Wuhan closes coronavirus hospital as officials hail drop in new cases.

Although the blow to the economy was only temporary, and in the following quarters, economic growth returned to its previous level of more than 10%.\nBut now, Garcia Herrero pointed out that \"China's dependence on consumption is far more than that in 2003, and consumption is bound to slow down.\" In addition to luxury goods and durable goods, the same is true of the hotel industry. \"Many industries will be affected. Their importance to China's economic growth is much higher than that in 2003, when external demand was the key,\" he pointed out.\nS & P global ratings pointed out in a report: \"in 2019, China's consumption contributed nearly 3.5 percentage points to the real growth of 6.1% of GDP. Rapid calculation shows that if the expenditure of these service industries decreases by 10%, the total GDP growth rate will decrease by about 1.2 percentage points.\".\nThe initial signs are not encouraging. Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 2.4% when they reopened after the holiday. Due to the closure of major TV stations and the suspension of large premieres, in the new year, when box office records are often broken,\nAccording to the ticketing company Mao Yan, the box office of the cinema was only 1.81 million yuan, about 250000 euros. Compared with the previous year, it decreased by 99%.\n\"It is certain that the outbreak of coronavirus will have an impact on economic growth this quarter,\" Mark Williams of Capital Economics said in a report Compared with SARS, \"although this official response is more transparent and positive, which can prove to be more effective in curbing the virus, it may also cause greater initial economic losses\".\nA large part of the damage may be related to China's huge underground economic sector, namely urban migration. Returning to the countryside to celebrate the festival with their families, many people were isolated or their travel plans changed. Long term unemployment will make them lose their income during unemployment.\nHuang Tianlei of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (piIe) pointed out: \"after SARS, China adopted expansionary fiscal policies, including tax cuts, to help the most affected sectors recover.\". \"This time, China has a large fiscal deficit, so there is less room for fiscal stimulus than at that time. In terms of monetary policy, the central bank can increase liquidity support, but there will be no credit driven stimulus.\"\nAnalysts pointed out that the key lies in the speed of crisis resolution. \"It depends on how the crisis is alleviated, especially how the Chinese government manages the crisis - no matter how transparent the crisis is - the cost may exacerbate the slowdown in China's economic growth,\" Huang Guangyu said.\n"}, {"content": "There were 3 cases of virus infection in Wuhan, France, ranking first in Europe. Wuhan virus has reached Europe. Especially in France, three cases have been confirmed, two in Paris and one in Bordeaux, according to the Ministry of health on Friday. This announcement is consistent with an ongoing study in Spain, which is studying whether a woman recently returned from China in the Basque region is infected with coronavirus because she has coronavirus related symptoms. Just last Friday, the Spanish Ministry of health ruled out two other possible infectious diseases, and the United States found another possible infectious disease. According to the latest data of Bloomberg, 41 people have died and 41 million people have been isolated in China.\nWhen announcing the first two cases in the evening, French health minister AGN è s buzyn warned that all signs showed that these European cases were not the only cases. Soon after, his office confirmed a third case, involving one of the first two cases. \"There are probably other\" infected people in European territory, \"Buzan said. For him, the virus\" is a fire that must be delimited \".\nIn all French cases, they were people who had been to China, and at least one of them was recorded in Wuhan. Buzan explained at the press conference that this is a 48 year old Chinese citizen. He came to a medical center on Thursday, 23rd to \"consult symptoms\". After returning to China the day before, he stayed in Wuhan for \"professional reasons\". The affected person was kept in a separate room in Bordeaux the night before yesterday. He was \"very good\", although before his condition was confirmed, \"he has contacted about 10 people since he returned to France\". He said the health authorities would \"contact\" these people to determine their health status.\nTwo cases in Paris are little known. In the first announcement, Buzan revealed that he was sent to the capital bicat hospital. \"We know this man has been to China, but we don't know if he is in Wuhan,\" the professional doctor added. In a statement issued at midnight, his department said that another case under investigation had been confirmed and related to one of the first patients. The third person affected is also in Paris. There is no news except that he is also in China. \"All isolation and hygiene measures have been taken,\" the Ministry of Health said.\nBuzan insisted that it was \"possible\" to find new affected persons in France, although he promised that every effort was being made to \"curb\" the spread of the virus in the country. The minister asked tourists returning from China not to go to the hospital emergency room in case of any signs of discomfort, but to contact the health authorities by telephone \"to avoid any potential infectious diseases\".\nMeanwhile, in Spain, the public health and addiction Bureau of the Ministry of health of the Basque government received a report on a suspected Chinese coronavirus associated pneumonia this afternoon. She is a woman who recently returned from Wuhan, China, suffering from diseases related to this disease. According to the European news agency, she was quarantined at cruise university hospital. The Basque Ministry of Health reported that the analytical samples have been sent to the National Microbiology center in majada Banda, which is a reference laboratory for this specific analysis, and the results are expected to be published within 24-48 hours.\nIn addition, two other cases suspected of Wuhan coronavirus in Spain were tested negative. On Friday afternoon, the Ministry of Health informed Fernando Simon, director of the health coordination and emergency center of the Ministry of health, that two people were being studied for possible infection, Since both of them recently arrived in Spain from Chinese cities, the source of infection showed some symptoms.\nUnited States health authority\nOn Friday, a U.S. hospital confirmed the country's second case of invasive coronavirus. Like the first case found in Seattle last weekend, this is a person who recently went to Wuhan, a health crisis center.\nSo far, the virus has killed 41 people, all in China, except two in Wuhan. More than 1100 people in the country have been polluted, of which nearly 200 are in serious condition. The authorities are also monitoring 1072 suspicious cases. So far, the virus has reached Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Nepal, Taiwan, Macao, the United States, France and Japan.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: supply bottlenecks in industry and commerce.\nThe consequences of the Coronavirus epidemic in China will increasingly affect German industry and trade in the coming weeks.\nAs many Chinese factories have been shut down for weeks and are currently operating only in limited quantities, there are no pre-products, parts or complete products processed or sold in China. The electronics sector is affected, among other things. Not only imports but also deliveries to China have been destroyed.\nIn fact, EU trade ministers wanted to discuss the issue on Thursday, but the meeting is cancelled. The average transport time from China to Europe by sea is six weeks, over land by freight train on the New Silk Road is about three weeks. Therefore, the effects of the Chinese coronation standstill are now being felt with delay on production and trade in Europe.\nWith imports of 52 billion euros, China is \"by far the largest foreign supplier for the German electricity market\", says Andreas Gontermann, the chief national value of the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries (ZVEI). \"But many companies report disruptions in the supply and production chains.\"\nGontermann quantifies the volume of intermediate products delivered from China to Germany at a value of ten billion euro a year. \"How much of this is at risk of being delivered is difficult to estimate. \"In addition, inputs from other countries can also contain Chinese inputs,\" says Gontermann. Thus, Japanese and South Korean economies are currently only slowed down, both countries are very important for the electronics industry.\nConsumers are also likely to feel the effects on the electricity markets. \"Currently, there are no supply bottlenecks due to the restrictions of the Coronavirus, we are currently expecting the first possible supply bottlenecks and rising commodity withholding prices for April. \"says Alexander Maier, Senior Vice President at Ingram Micro, a wholesaler for electrical and electronic products based in the Munich suburb of Aschheim.\"We are currently working on strategies to respond quickly to these impacts and continue to offer our customers the best possible product availability.\"\nThe automotive industry is also concerned. \"Production is currently in progress at all locations,\" says an audio speaker in Ingolstadt. \"Of course, it is impossible to see how the situation will develop in the medium term, especially with regard to the supply chain. We try to alleviate potential bottlenecks by targeted measures.\"\nAudi is based in Bavaria, where companies are particularly dependent on abroad and earn more than half of their turnover outside German borders. \"Supply chains between China and Bavaria are interrupted and are now even more severely interrupted in the coming weeks, for example, if Bertram Brossardt, the chief manager of the Association of Bavarian Economy, says.\nThe most important import goods from China for the Bavarian economy are data processing equipment, electronic and optical products, electrical equipment and machines. \"We expect a disruption of the supply chains approximately proportional to the volume of the individual product groups. \"says Brossardt. This should apply similarly to companies in the rest of the Republic supplied from China.\nFor outsiders, the impact on the supply of medicines cannot be estimated. According to the Federal Institute of Medicines and Medical Products in Bonn, there are currently no coronavirus-related bottlenecks. However, India, where many imitation medicines are produced for the world market, has exported last week 26 common active substances, including paracetamol and several antibiotics.\nA major wholesaler of medicines is Phoenix Pharmahandel, based in Mannheim, and the company is walled: \"We cannot evaluate the issue of your request The Pharmaceutical Association Progenerika states that it is not expected that Corona will cause congestion in the UK until the summer 2020.\nWhat then comes? \"Not to be seen yet.\" (dpa)\n"}, {"content": "The informant. He is now the most famous virologist in Germany. 2003, he has deciphered the Sars virus, now developing the first detection test for the new Coronavirus from Wuhan. Everyone's been asking for his advice ever since. It should be impossible to get close to Christian Drosten.\nBut the director of the Institute of Virology at the Berlin Charite is radically adhering to a strategy that he has already made his credo during the Sars epidemic: all information must be out, everything must be made public. It's the only way to keep a virus in check. So Christian Drosten is in a hurry, he is a little late, he was just in the Foreign Office, last Monday in his office, quickly looks through a few emails, takes a place at a round natural wood table, leans back and is focused.\nIn view of technical progress, is the situation not much better today than during the Sars epidemic? \"I don't know,\" says Drosten. On the one hand, with many genome analyses, it was quickly discovered that the virus has not been circulating among humans for long. \"This is good to assess the epidemic.\" On the other hand, the mobility of Chinese society has changed dramatically. \"I can well imagine that the rapid spread of the current virus can only be explained by this.\"\nThe 47-year-old physician has spent his entire professional life dealing with coronary viruses. When the Sars pathogen (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) entered its course at the end of 2002, no one knew at first what kind of germ it was. At that time Christian Drosten worked at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and developed diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. The young scientist was able to identify the agent of Sars, a Coronavirus similar to the current 2019-nCoV in China.\nAt the time, he was able to present a proof test with a colleague. Two years later, he was awarded the Federal Merit Cross. When he was only 35 years old, Drosten moved to the Institute of Virology at Bonn University Hospital, and ten years later he joined the Charity.\nThere, the virologist and his team have been tracking every angle of the new Coronavirus for weeks now. Without having it in the lab himself, he developed the test for it.\nDrosten doesn't claim to understand the virus yet. Like all parties involved, he has to deal with the fact that the data situation changes hourly. At first it was said from China that the virus could not be transmitted from person to person. That was soon past. Then it was said that drastic measures such as the closure of entire metropolises could contain the virus in China. A false assumption.\nThe image of the Coronavirus is sharper than that of the fast-moving media world. That is why Drosten formulates only one working hypothesis on this day: the new Coronavirus is basically like Sars. At this point he deduces that 2019-nCoV can only be transmitted by people with symptoms.\nOne day later, it is said that in Bavaria, a Chinese woman from Shanghai transmitted the virus to employees of a company, allegedly asymptomatic. An alarm signal: In asymptomatic hosts, the virus can travel far unknown and infect many people on the way. In the renowned New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) a specialist article on the Bavarian case appears, the Global Health Emergency is called by the WHO.\nA week later, it is clear that the Chinese woman had back pain and was taking a fever-reducing medicine, which is why the infection was not noticed, and that the authors of the article had not spoken to the Chinese woman. Christian Drosten's name was also included in the publication. He's uncomfortable with that. Normally, one examines all the facts in a group of authors, he says, \"but in this case I simply had to trust the authors who have spent much longer on the case history of patients\". As a confirmation laboratory, he only supplied data, which he stands for.\nBut isn't this breakdown an example of how premature publication of data is harmful?\nBut threats remain with his demand for maximum transparency. The fact that the patient had still given lectures despite the illness and could infect colleagues shows that the virus spread more easily than\nMost likely. But the breakdown with the article in the NEJM proves another worrying development. \"Journals today actively press for speed and want sensation.\" And this also applies to high-level publications.\nDrosten published the very first paper on the novel Coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, the scientific journal of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. \"We could have published this in the NEJM,\" he says, \"but we did not do it intentionally.\" He was more concerned that all data should be made fully available online so that everyone can read it.\nThe only thing that helps in a situation with insufficient data is transparency, Drosten says. It is only when all the information is immediately available to the relevant institutions that incorrect assumptions can be corrected and proper reactions can be initiated. When he advocated this rigorous demand during the Sars epidemic and published genetic data early, he says it was \"totally unusual\". And today he is angry that some colleagues still did not understand it and withheld important current data.\nDrosten is also fighting behind the scenes for science journals to introduce new transparency rules. Manuscripts should only be accepted as part of an outbreak if the authors simultaneously deposited the data on a publicly accessible pre-print server. \"This is the only regulation that can work to finally achieve transparency in this system or to prevent the system from slowing down progress in the fight against epidemics.\"\nThe virologist himself also practices transparency in the public. A colleague of his says that Drosten is one of the few virologists who fully understand epidemics, both the molecular biological side and the clinical aspects and the educational work.\nHe has learned from the Sars crisis, says Drosten, that in addition to the transparent dissemination of scientific data, open communication with the population is essential. \"Knowledge of the disease alone at the time in Hong Kong was sufficient to get patients to see a doctor sooner.\" If the situation escalates as it is now in Wuhan, then \"any drastic message is useful\". Because only then would people change their behaviour: avoid the accumulation of people and maintain the necessary social distance.\nSpreading his knowledge is now eating up much of Christian Drosten's time. Which is not entirely safe for him. \"I'm not sure if being a scientist makes up for that,\" he says, \"you have to be careful not to become a television professor.\"\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. E ha\nThese are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\n"}, {"content": "RPT-China stocks off 2020 lows as Beijing calms nerves over virus outbreak.

A new virus put China on alert. This is a mysterious pneumonia, which has infected dozens of people in Wuhan. It corresponds to a new coronavirus like strain that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002. According to the research of a group of scientists, China's state television CCTV confirmed this, and they successfully isolated the gene sequence of the source of infection.\nSince early December, 15 of the 59 cases found in Wuhan, Hubei Province have been confirmed by medical examination. Most of these infections come from a fish and shellfish market where there are live animals. Since then, the area has been blocked and isolated. So far, no patient has died, and even eight patients were discharged yesterday Wednesday without any symptoms. Local health authorities have ensured that no human to human transmission has been detected.\nCoronavirus, named after the coronavirus of coronavirus, is observed under a microscope and usually attacks the respiratory tract of mammals. So far, they know only six people. Four can cause mild cold symptoms. The other two are notorious: in 2002, the SARS coronavirus originated in China killed more than 700 people all over the world; In 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome caused 449 deaths.\nIn view of this background, the news has aroused concern in the country. \"I'm very scared. I remember SARS appeared together before the Spring Festival, and then spread due to transportation,\" wrote a microblog user similar to twitter. His words refer to the Chinese new year on January 25, 2020. On this national day, it is a tradition for people to return home, which has led to the world's largest human migration and the displacement of more than 3 billion people: it is an ideal place for the spread of the virus.\nHowever, this mysterious disease may have crossed the border of the Asian giant. In South Korea, a Chinese woman was imprisoned in solitary confinement for possible infection, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported on Wednesday. The 36 year old woman was diagnosed with pneumonia on Tuesday after two business trips to Wuhan. At the same time, neighbouring countries have begun to strengthen airport security measures.\nThe World Health Organization believes that there is no need to develop special measures for travelers at present. He announced this in a statement issued this morning and pledged that \"new coronaviruses appear regularly [...] China has a sound health system that can respond to and manage outbreaks of respiratory infections\". The agency expressed its willingness to provide technical support to the country's health authorities and ruled that \"more comprehensive information is needed in the coming weeks in order to better understand the current situation and epidemiology of the epidemic\".\nThe scientists responsible for identifying the virus expressed the same view, and they promised that their initial discovery needed more research. Although evidence of the presence of pathogens can be obtained in a short time, vaccine production may take years. Professor David Hui Shu Cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, assured the South China Morning Post that some key details still need to be clarified, such as \"animals are the source, incubation period and transmission route of the virus\". Some experts, such as Peng Yihong, a professor at Beijing Medical College, ventured that the cause of the outbreak may be \"pathogens contained in karst caves, and many seafood will be transported to the market\".\n"}, {"content": "Why all coronavirus cases in India are from Kerala. \nThe spotlight is now turned on the connect between Wuhan and Kerala as India's all three positive novel coronavirus cases so far are students of a university in the historic Chinese city, the epicentre of the epidemic.\nWuhan has been a popular destination for Keralites and others as an educational hub with quality and affordable medical courses attracting overseas scholars.\nImpressed by factors like affordability, amenities and international standards in medical education, offered in English, students from Kerala have been flocking to Wuhan University School of Medicine in China.\nWuhan, over 1,000 km from Chinese capital of Beijing and 800 plus km away from the top class metropolis Shanghai, is a historic city and played a key role in the 20th century history of China.\n\"I am very happy about the medical education system at Wuhan university.

Now comes the tricky part - shipping it there: Russell. LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Developed countries pump aid to fight Covid-19, Britain latest to face lockdown.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Chinese scientists reported on Thursday (March 26) it is possible, although rare, for pregnant mothers with the Covid-19 illness to pass the infection down to their babies. \n The team followed 33 pregnant women from Wuhan, the city where the disease behind a deadly pandemic was first identified - and found that three babies were infected with the new coronavirus at birth (a rate of nine per cent, albeit in a very small sample). \n They reported their findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics, where they wrote: \"Because strict infection control and prevention procedures were implemented during the delivery, it is likely that the sources of SARS-CoV-2 in the neonates' upper respiratory tracts or anuses were maternal in origin.\" \n SARS-CoV-2 is the technical name for the virus. \n All three of the infected babies were male, and all were delivered by cesarean because their mothers had Covid-19 associated pneumonia. \n In addition, one of them was delivered prematurely, at 31 weeks, because of fetal distress, and required resuscitation. \n The two babies that were delivered on time experienced lethargy and fever, and one had pneumonia.

Grace Dowell, a 63-year-old grandmother, has stopped grocery shopping and cancelled all her doctor’s appointments. No one is allowed into her rural Maryland home. Every piece of mail is disinfected.  \n Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly.  \n Dowell, a retired labour union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother’s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home.  \n “If my mom gets this, she’d be gone in a day,” said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother’s calls for help through the night. “My mom beat cancer nine times. I don’t want her to die from this.”  \n The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities.  \n Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world’s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data.  \n Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation.  \n “They need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,” said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. “I’m taking care of myself, as God orders.”  \n Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance.  \n “I am not worried about the coronavirus at all,” said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. “People of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.”  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Coronavirus kills older people at much higher rates - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AGE/0100B5L744Y/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS.jpg)  \n  \n ‘HELLO GRAN, HOW ARE YOU?’  \n In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called “Ciao Nonna, come stai?” or “Hello Gran, how are you?” urging all young people to call elderly relatives – or even older people they don’t know.  \n One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones.  \n Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn’t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but\ncan’t get tested because of a shortage of kits.  \n “I feel strange and frustrated,” Barrios said. “All I can do for my grandparents is to call them.”  \n The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone.  \n Only six or seven people attended her husband’s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted “dozens and dozens.” They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service.  \n \"She can't mourn properly,” he said. “She cannot do it with friends.”  \n  \n ‘IF I GET IT, I GET IT’  \n Some families have been hit hard when senior care centres closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them.  \n Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation’s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again.  \n \"If I get it, I get it,” said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. “If you get too nervous about it all, that isn't good, either.\"  \n Many elderly people said they can’t follow government directives to stay home.  \n In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighbourhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people – especially the elderly – about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer.  \n Juma, who says she’s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn’t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said.  \n “This government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,” she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. “If there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.”  \n In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America’s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meagre pensions.

Given the threat of coronavirus, both are in masks and the priest is seated a distance away.\nAnother perhaps reflecting matrimony many years down the line has a woman, her brows knitted together as she wields a spoon over a wok, and her smiling husband slouched on the sofa watching 'Lock-down special' on TV. \"No, he is not helping at all.

The man calls her only to be told that she is working from home and will tell him what needs to be cleaned in his home -- overturning the class dynamic while stressing that coronavirus affects everyone.\nAnother has a father trying to put his crying child to sleep.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. \n There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. \n Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. \n A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. \n The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. \n THE WILDLIFE TRADE THREATENS HUMAN HEALTH \n Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather than being the source of the virus. \n They were probably infected during the “speed dating” of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. \n At the Royal Society’s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. \n But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. \n A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. \n But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that “15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis”. \n  \n The report continues: “Despite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.” \n It is not evident what “environmental specimens” refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. \n Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. \n PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR PANDEMICS \n But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. \n The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. \n First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. \n Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. \n And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. \n  \n It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. \n WILL REMOVING SUCH MARKETS HELP? \n The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and “farms” (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). \n The call to close wildlife markets across China – which started following the SARS outbreak – has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. \n We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgentl\ny needed to protect human health and the environment. \n Diana Bell is Professor of Conservation Biology, University of East Anglia.

The new diagnostic criteria, which are only being used in Hubei, give doctors greater discretion in determining which patients are infected.\nIn addition to causing a dramatic increase in the number of deaths and cases, the inclusion of clinical diagnostics in the count seems to confirm suspicions that the actual number of cases far exceeds the official balances of recent weeks, writes the newspaper \"South China Morning Post\".\nThe new monitoring protocol coincides with the purging of top Communist Party figures in Hubei, where local authorities have become the target of public criticism of the Central Government's response to the outbreak.\nThe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi guarantees that the effect of the virus on the economy is temporary and that the country will do everything it can to minimise the impact. Alongside his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, at a press conference in Berlin, Wang said, \"I believe that when the epidemic is over consumption will quickly return to normal levels and economic impetus will have a resilient recovery.\"\nThe head of Chinese diplomacy also appealed to joint efforts around the world to contain the virus, adding that his country effectively prevented the outbreak from spreading to other countries.\nOverall, Covid-19 infected about 65 thousand people and spread to 24 countries.

I don't know what their reasons are. I know that apparently more and more people are suffering there.

Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n “It is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,” he said.   \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore’s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.  \n Why is this so? \n Let’s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research’s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.  \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years’ time, the Singapore residential\nmarket could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.  \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy – construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.  \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both consumers and the economy. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield.\n"}, {"content": "World should learn lessons from China in coronavirus fight - China Daily.

SINGAPORE — The Singapore stock market on Monday (March 9) suffered its largest single-day drop since October 2008, as markets around the globe were battered following a plunge in oil prices that fuelled rising alarm over the economic impact of Covid-19. \n After weeks of slow and gradual decline, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) nosedived 6 per cent — shedding 178.61 points to 2,782.37. \n It was the worst fall since the height of the global financial crisis and dragged the main market index to its lowest levels since 2016. \n The massive selloff across the globe was triggered by a plunge in oil prices after the world’s major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on cutting production, which sparked a price-cutting war in an environment where supply is exceeding waning demand. \n Among many global losers, Japan’s Nikkei sank 5 per cent and Australia’s ASX 200 dived 7.3 per cent. \n Market experts in Singapore warned investors not to take their chances during such turbulent times, and to leave the analysis and guesswork to the professionals. \n The STI, an index which tracks the performance of the top 30 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, saw all three banks here — DBS, OCBC and UOB — fall by at least 6 per cent. Conglomerate Keppel Corp tanked by almost 10 per cent, Genting Singapore dropped 6 per cent and Singapore Airlines was down 4.5 per cent. \n Analysts warned investors against thinking that this might sound like a good time to enter the stock market and pick up some bargains among blue chips. \n They said that this is a time to be extra cautious because the confluence of factors that are causing the current market carnage is unprecedented, and there is no knowing how long the market bloodshed will last. \n WHY DID THE MARKET PLUNGE? \n The plunge in the STI, experts told TODAY, was largely due to a meeting of two “black swans”— an oil price war and an airline industry robbed of demand from the Covid-19 outbreak. A black swan event is one that comes as a complete surprise and has deep consequences. \n On Friday, Russia refused to join the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in a large production cut as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to slow the global economy along with the demand for oil, the New York Times reported. \n In retaliation, Saudi Arabia decided to cut oil prices by nearly 10 per cent on Saturday. \n Price wars such as these have led to steep falls in oil prices before, as in 2016. However, experts said that with the Covid-19 outbreak looming in the background, there are no “winners” in this situation. \n Mr Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, said that when there is a sharp fall in oil prices, there will normally be winners and losers, but in this instance, it is a “loser-loser” situation. \n “Normally, the airline industry has been the primary beneficiary of such a sharp plunge in oil prices. Now, no one wants to take (a plane). \n “Had it just been the oil price war without the coronavirus outbreak fears, we would all be travelling to Japan for S$1 priced tickets. But now, even with that pricing, we would be scared to go,” he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, a market strategist at brokerage firm IG, said that besides the fall in oil prices, the increase in the number of infections outside of China has caused negative sentiment in the market. \n This is due to the growth in Covid-19 cases in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea, where case numbers have spiked from the tens to the thousands in the span of weeks. \n “The backdrop still being the coronavirus impact that’s causing quite a lot of turmoil in the market,” she said. “The hit on demand is already the general situation in the market, and the market has processed that in.” \n WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? \n Mr Terence Wong, chief executive officer of fund management company Azure Capital, said that due to the “many unknowns out there”, punters should not be investing “aggressively” at the moment. \n “It could have other impacts on other parts of the economy that you may not think about,” he said. “If you asked me last week, I couldn’t tell that this would happen… There will be a high degree of risk (to invest) right now.” \n Agreeing, Mr Song said that investment during such dire circumstances should be left to the professionals. \n “We have the virus outbreak plus a price war, I don’t think laymen are equipped to dea\nl with this kind of fluid landscape,” he said. \n Though the experts generally warned against investing during this period of turmoil, there could be a sliver of opportunity for those willing to take the risk. \n If one had to choose certain industries to invest in, it should be more stable industries such as primarily consumer staples, which includes producers of food, household goods and other essentials, Ms Pan said. \n Mr Song added that the healthcare sector, especially health care services and medical equipment manufacturers, are set to do well during this period. \n A larger risk would be to invest in cyclical stocks, those that are tied to the business cycle, Ms Pan said. These include companies in the industrial sector or those that deal with energy production. \n WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE STOCK MARKET \n The rate at which the market will recover depends not just on the spread of the virus, but the fear among the population, the analysts said. \n Mr Wong of Azure Capital believes that the market will recover when the number of cases stabilises. Now that the number of cases is still “jumping around”, this will cause uncertainty in the market, he said. \n “If you look at China, the number of new cases has already been decreasing,” he said. “If, globally, we didn’t see wild numbers… I think we could have already made a recovery in the market.” \n Mr Song agreed that consumer fears play a bigger role in curbing demand than the actual number of cases does. \n “(Chances of a rebound) depends on how confident market participants are about the outbreak being contained, the most important being the fear factor,” he said. \n However, when a rebound will come is hard to tell, which makes it difficult to know when one should start investing again. \n Ms Pan said: “With every market shock, there will be a recovery, but the problem this time is that we are dealing with something that is very uncertain (with the) coronavirus. Perhaps we will need to see a vaccine come through, to be a remedy (to the economy).” \n In the meantime, players in the market can only hope that the worst will be over soon, but there is no indication of how big the hit on the market will continue to be, or how long it will last. \n The analysts said that they expect the STI to fall further to around 2,500-point levels, down from the current 2,782. \n In the last five years, STI closed at its lowest of 2,539 points in February 2016. \n Mr Wong said that it is ultimately wiser to hold off investing during an uncertain economy rather than hope to profit from it. \n “You can see the tide coming, but you can’t tell how big it’s going to be,” he said. “If it’s a ripple, that’s fine. But what if it builds up to a tsunami wave? \n “There’s no need to be a hero… I still think that cash (rather than investments) will be king right now.”\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 4-U.S. could be next 'virus epicentre', as India locks down, global recession looms.

SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday (Jan 22) that it is setting up a multi-ministry task force to tackle the mysterious Wuhan virus that has already infected more than 400 people in China. \n Although it has yet to reach Singapore's shores, increased air travel in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays has led to the ministry - as well as other agencies across the world - stepping up precautionary measures to either prevent entry of the disease or contain its spread. \n As of Wednesday afternoon, the Wuhan virus, a type of coronavirus which causes pneumonia in its victims, has claimed nine lives. \n But what is the virus and how did the Wuhan virus spread to people? \n Here are some questions and answers about the Wuhan coronavirus behind the latest outbreak. \n Viruses are microscopic parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which includes animal, humans and even bacteria. \n For this reason, it is debatable if they are truly \"alive\". They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n Even so, viruses are made of biological material and have the biggest population of any biological entity on earth, triggering responses in living things that range from unnoticeable reactions to death. \n Some experts believe that nearly 10 per cent of the current human genome is viral genetic material, as a result of viruses infecting human cells for millennia. \n They belong to a large group of viruses that usually infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n But from the mid-1960s, scientists began identifying coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date, according to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with well-known symptoms such as sore throats, cough, and headaches. \n But the remaining three have more recently caused severe repercussions on human health as scientists scrambled to understand them. \n The first is the infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers-CoV), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread further, and the latest Wuhan virus (2019-nCov) which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n Scientists have speculated that the virus from the latest Wuhan outbreak, like the Mers and Sars viruses that preceded it, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n This ability of a virus to \"jump\" from animals to humans is not unusual and has given rise to a category of illnesses called zoonotic diseases, which also counts among its ranks diseases caused by non-coronavirus viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ebola. \n Zoonotic viruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called RNA, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded DNA, which accounts for their virality. \n To date, the Wuhan coronavirus has been closely linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts in addition to seafood. \n Scientists have said such \"unnatural situations\", where animals are brought together and often housed in bad conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for viruses to hop between animals. The virus could then have changed so that it is able to infect humans and eventually start spreading between people. \n Every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director of research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Bioinformatics Institute. \n \"Viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... Some viruses mutate much faster,\" he added. \n The Wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object with the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes. \n For now, virologists have said that th\ne Wuhan coronavirus - based on reported rates of infection - is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus. But there are concerns that the Wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal. \n Dr Michael Wong, a senior family physician at Raffles Medical, said the virulence of the Wuhan virus cannot be underestimated. “With mutations, the virus could increase in virulence and transmissibility, leading to a serious pandemic,” he said. \n The Chinese government has classified the Wuhan virus outbreak in the same category as the Sars epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel, said Dr Wong. \n There are also worries that the number of infections is yet under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu. \n It is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the Sars virus. \n The World Health Organisation estimates that the overall fatality rate for Sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for Wuhan is currently at 2 per cent. \n Researchers have said that the Wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the Sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\". \n There is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. Recent reports have also suggested that the Wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too. \n No, said professor Paul Tambyah, from the department of medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \n “I don’t think we should panic as panic is never a good approach.” \n Instead, we should be concerned. \n He said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. The public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said. \n Wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu, to prevent the transmission of airborne germs. \n Some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people may wonder if they should dig out their N95 masks too. \n But there is no need to, said professor Leo Yee Sin, the executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Instead, they should wear surgical masks.  \n “N95 masks are of a very special design. They are very difficult to breathe in. If you find the N95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrong and it’s no use,” she said. “It’s only when it is difficult to breathe that you are wearing it correctly.” \n It is thus not recommended for the general public, she said. \n In fact, if you use it wrongly, it may make things worse because you think you are protected when you are not, she said. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there’s human to human transmission. \n The MOH on Thursday said Singaporeans should avoid travelling to Wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on Wednesday for people to defer non-essential travel there. \n The ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the developing novel coronavirus situation in Wuhan and other parts of China\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which abuts densely populated Hong Kong. \n It also cited the travel halt imposed by the Chinese authorities on Thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended. \n The MOH reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon returning to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history, said the ministry. \n If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit. \n Singapore is stepping up precautionary measures, in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China – not just Wuhan alone – at Changi Airport from Wednesday\n and issuing health advisory notices to them. \n “However, people who are in the incubation period – likely seven to 14 days based on known characteristics of other corona viruses – might not have started showing symptoms such as a fever, and, hence, not be detected by the thermal scanners,” said Raffles Medical’s Dr Wong. \n “With increased awareness of the infection, it is hoped that those who experience symptoms would isolate themselves and see a doctor as soon as possible so as to prevent spreading the infection.” \n There is no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the Wuhan virus. \n Patients typically recover on their own after some time by depending on their immune system to fight the infection. \n Treatment mostly involves tackling flu-like symptoms from infections and making patients more comfortable, such as providing them with breathing apparatus to help with breathing difficulties. \n In some cases, antiviral drugs are available to shorten the duration or reduce the severity of the illness by decreasing the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce, effectively isolating it. \n A*Star's Dr Maurer-Stroh said that \"as a rule of thumb, a virus that spreads widely is often less severe\". \n A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the Wuhan coronavirus. There is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. The influenza virus, that a flu jab protects against, is not a coronavirus. \n However, according to an advisory from Raffles Medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to exposed areas to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms and signs that may mislead screening authorities at temperature checkpoints.\n"}, {"content": "Beijing quarantines returning residents as China struggles to pick up economy. People returning to the Chinese capital Beijing from extended holidays on Friday were ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to help prevent spread of the new coronavirus, as hard-hit Hubei province reported more than 2,400 new cases.\nThe official Beijing Daily newspaper said people failing to obey would be punished but it was not immediately clear how that would be enforced, or whether the restrictions would apply to non-residents of Beijing or foreigners arriving from abroad.\n\"From now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,\" read the notice from Beijing's virus prevention working group cited by the Beijing Daily.\n\"Those who refuse to accept home or centralized observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under law,\" it said.\nStricter containment measures were planned elsewhere as well.

Meetings are held online, not in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperature twice a day as fever is one of the virus' main symptoms.\nOutside mainland China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 24 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.\nWUHAN'S SELF-HELP\nWuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, has been hardest hit by the virus.\nWith all public transport, taxis and ride-hailing services shut down in the city, volunteer drivers are responding to requests on ad hoc messaging groups to ferry medical staff and others in vital jobs to and from work, risking their own health.\nOthers work round the clock to find accommodation for medical workers in hotels that have volunteered rooms.

This led the Institute to send a letter to NEJM requesting correction of the article and informing the World Health Organization (who) and other European institutions of the new findings.\nThis article has had a great impact on the scientific community, because it is the first article published in a famous magazine, confirming the progress of Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei, Sunday, January 26: people with the disease can spread the virus a few days before their first symptoms.\n\"After reading this article, there is no doubt that the transmission of asymptomatic patients is taking place,\" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of infectious diseases and allergy. Major media around the world, including national media, also responded to the relevance of NEJM.\nDespite what happened to NEJM, Fauci was convinced that infection was occurring in asymptomatic people. Fauci explained to science: \"I called a colleague of mine in China. He is a respected health scientist. He told me that he is convinced that some people are asymptomatic infected with the disease and some asymptomatic infected people are spreading the disease.\".\nThe possibility that asymptomatic patients may be infected with coronavirus reminds experts that this will bring difficulties in controlling the spread of pathogens. For example, this will force exposure studies of confirmed patients to expand to a few days before the onset of symptoms and weaken control measures taken at many airports, such as temperature monitoring.\nIncubation periods - when a patient has been infected with the virus but has not yet developed symptoms - and transmission - when he can transmit the virus - sometimes overlap - are not uncommon in infectious and respiratory diseases. This is why doctors and scientists have been waiting for information and research almost from the early stage of the epidemic in Wuhan to clarify whether this has happened.\n\"This will increase uncertainty about the effectiveness of some preventive measures,\" Jesus Rodr í Guez bath, director of infectious disease services at virgin Macarena hospital in Seville, explained to this newspaper last Friday. International health service doctors at Barcelona Clinic Hospital and isglobal researchers added: \"it will make sense to detect asymptomatic cases when we know whether this happens always or only in some cases. There are still some unknown factors to be solved.\".\nBoth researchers believe that the question is still unanswered. Although they stressed that \"in any case, the transmission of coronaviruses is mainly caused by patients who are already ill. If asymptomatic transmission exists, they play a secondary role in the development of the epidemic\".\nThe who said last Saturday in its daily report on the development of the epidemic\nIt is reported that \"2019-ncov may spread\", the temporary name of the pathogen, \"before some infected people have symptoms\". IAEA referred to ongoing research \"to better understand the preclinical phase of infection and how it spreads\".

There are concerns that the novel coronavirus infection is ditching desperate attempts that are being made by different governments to contain it. What is alarming is that the pandemic is accelerating in many countries.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) fears that after Europe, the United States is on the course of becoming the next hotspot of Covid-19. India is among the countries that are being anxiously followed by WHO and others.\nTo understand how grave the situation of novel coronavirus spread is, let us check the numbers of its progression globally. On December 31, China informed the WHO about cases of pneumonia due to some mysterious ailment in Wuhan city. There have been reports, however, about a viral outbreak in Wuhan.\nOn January 5, China ruled out a coronavirus outbreak saying it was not a SARS virus recurrence (sever acute respiratory syndrome), an illness that had turned epidemic after its outbreak in China and Hong Kong in 2002.\nTwo days later on January 7, China announced having identified the virus as novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV. On January 11, China reported first death due to novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan. Second death was reported on January 17.\nBetween two novel coronavirus deaths, Covid-19 cases were reported from Thailand and Japan. Soon countries including South Korea, the US, France, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nepal reported cases of novel coronavirus infection. But all cases were traced to infection in China.\nOn January 31, the WHO declared novel coronavirus outbreak an \"international emergency\" recognizing it as a risk to other countries. China had by then report nearly 9,700 cases and 213 deaths due to novel coronavirus.\nThe disease was spreading fast but it accelerated after it reached 1 lakh-mark globally. The WHO said it took 67 days for Covid-19 outbreak to infect first 1 lakh patients on March 7.\nBut to infect another 1 lakh people, the coronavirus took just 12 days. On March 19, the numbers crossed 2 lakh. During this phase, the daily count of fresh novel coronavirus cases kept rising consistently barring on a few days. (See table below)\nThe next 1 lakh patients got Covid-19 in just four days, with global count crossing 3 lakh on March 23. On March 25, the WHO count for global Covid-19 patients crossed 4 lakh. It means the last 1 lakh novel coronavirus patients were added to the list in just two days.\nTotal deaths as on March 25 due to Covid-19 stood at 18,440 with more than 2200 losing the battle against novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to WHO report.\nNow compare this trend with the trend in India.\nIndia reported its first Covid-19 case on January 30. It was the same day that the WHO declared novel coronavirus a global emergency.\nBy February 3, there were three cases in India.\nOn February 20, all three Covid-19 patients were discharged after they recovered from infection.\nBy February 28, India had tested 2,880 samples, of which 1,572 were samples from outside quarantine centres. Only three had tested positive.\nMarch 2, two cases were reported - one each from Delhi and Hyderabad.\nOn March 10, the Covid-19 cases reached 50 and on March 15 it crossed 100-mark (107). On March 20 - with 50 new cases - novel coronavirus cases jumped to 223. That is, India reported 105 cases in 13 days between March 2 and 5. But in just next five days, the country recorded 118 more cases.\nIn another four days, the number crossed 500 on March 24, when official number of Covid-19 patients was 519. That is, India saw almost 300 fresh cases after it breached 200-mark.\nAt noon on March 26, the official data put the number of Covid-19 patients at 649, 593 of them being active cases treated in different hospitals. That is, in 15 days (March 11-26), coronavirus cases in India increased nearly 13 times.\nThe official death count due to novel coronavirus infection stood at 13 while 42 Covid-19 have been cured and discharged from hospitals.\nClearly, India is following the same pattern as other novel coronavirus-affected countries across continents. The only relief here is that the number is not phenomenal given India's proximity to China and its huge population base. But some say the lower number is due to fewer than required testing done by government agencies in India.\nNow that national lockdown has been enforced, the authorities hope the accelerated rate of increase in novel coronavirus cases will slow down in\ndays to come.\n"}, {"content": "False claim: African skin resists the coronavirus.

Those issued the notice will have to stay home at all times for 14 days after returning to Singapore. \n Singapore will also cease port calls for all cruise vessels with immediate effect, the ministry added.  \n The latest round of stepped up border controls comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on Wednesday, as the coronavirus has infected more than 125,000 people in 118 countries, and killed more than 4,000. \n WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland that in the last two weeks alone, cases outside China have increased 13-fold and the number of affected countries has tripled. \n MOH said that as of March 12, almost 25 per cent of the confirmed cases in Singapore were imported.  \n In the last 10 days alone, there have been 23 imported cases, making up nearly a third of all new cases, including 13 people with travel history to European countries and six from Indonesia. \n Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: “We've said before that as we get further into the epidemic and as it becomes a global pandemic, increasingly border control measures may become less effective because we cannot identify specific countries. \n “But at this stage of the epidemic, we still see very high numbers and rapid increases in a few specific countries, especially in Europe. We are also seeing more imported cases recently, and that's why we think there is still a need to tighten border measures… in order to limit imported cases in Singapore.” \n He added that Singapore needs more “rigorous surveillance at our borders”. \n “Beyond specific countries, both previous and new ones we introduce today… (we are) concerned about countries with few reported cases of the virus. \n Mr Wong said these include neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, from which Singapore has had six imported cases, and Malaysia, where two Singaporeans attended a recent event and were diagnosed with Covid-19 after their return. \n Also speaking at the briefing, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong added that two days ago, Singapore saw its highest number of imported cases since the outbreak began.  \n “Control measures remain important to lower the risk of imported cases, (but) even as we continue to tighten border control, we know it would not be tenable for us to close borders to every affected country and region, and shut ourselves out,” he added. \n “We need to ensure measures are sustainable in the long term and life can go on.” \n Asked if the border restrictions were prompted by the move by the United States to ban travellers from European countries, Mr Wong said: “Our measures, social distancing or travel restrictions, are informed by data, evidence and expert advice, not based on what other countries are doing.” \n He added: “How long can we go on with this? We know what our limits are. If infection spreads at a rapid rate all over the world, continuing on this path would effectively shut Singapore out from the world and we don’t want to get there.” \n Mr Wong said that at some point, Singapore would want to shift to a different approach for border surveillance.  \n “If indeed we are moving in that direction, there will be a\nlimit to how many countries we impose travel restrictions on and we will need a different way of doing border surveillance.” \n MOH also issued a list of countries and regions with known and potential exported cases, and is advising Singaporeans to exercise caution when travelling to these places. \n Mainland China \n Egypt \n France \n Germany \n Hong Kong \n India \n Italy \n Indonesia \n Iran \n Israel \n Japan \n Malaysia \n Philippines \n Republic of Korea \n Spain \n Thailand \n United Kingdom \n United States\n"}, {"content": "Second Singaporean evacuated from Wuhan tested positive for coronavirus.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The language commonly used to describe speculative manias is borrowed from epidemiology. A new technology sparks “contagion”. Investors are “infected” with greed. Speculative “fever” breaks out. During the panic phase, contagion becomes more “virulent”. After the South Sea Bubble collapsed 300 years ago, contemporary observers likened the market situation to a plague. In fact, by late 1720 the bubonic plague was spreading across Europe. Today, the world is faced with another epidemic. The response to coronavirus resembles the inverse of a speculative mania, with fear replacing greed, and errors of pessimism those of optimism.\nIn his engaging and eerily well-timed new book, “The Rules of Contagion”, Adam Kucharski observes that bubbles and diseases go through similar growth phases. Both experience periods of exponential growth. Eventually the spread peaks, the bubble bursts and the number of infections declines sharply. A typical outbreak chart resembles an inverted “V”. Bubbles follow a similar trajectory. As the ecologist Robert May observed in 2013, “the recent rise in financial assets and the subsequent crash have rather precisely the same shape as the typical rise and fall of cases in an outbreak of measles or other infections.”\nFinancial bubbles and epidemics are both prone to cross borders. In 1720, the genie of speculation jumped from Paris to London, and later spread as far as Portugal and Russia. In the early months of 2020, Covid-19 was carried from Wuhan, China to much of the rest of the world. Bubbles produce unreal times: rumours abound and bizarre promotions are launched. Speculators snapped up shares 300 years ago in a company “for the immediate, expeditious and cleanly manner of emptying necessary houses [toilets] throughout England.” Their descendants have lately taken to stockpiling toilet rolls, a product that England still produces in ample quantity. In an atmosphere of dread, gossip and tall tales spread more virulently than the virus itself.\nBubbles are a form of social contagion. When the markets are soaring, “fear of missing out” drives investors. They lose the capacity to make reasoned judgments. Herd-like behaviour and groupthink prevail. Bullish narratives proliferate. It’s not just that speculators want to hear such stories: Wall Street is incentivised to circulate them. Optimistic visions are maintained in the face of contradictory evidence. During the late 1990s dotcom boom, for instance, Wall Street claimed that internet traffic was doubling every ten weeks. In fact, as researcher Andrew Odlyzko, now at the University of Minnesota, revealed at the time, traffic was growing one-tenth that fast. This inconvenient finding was ignored, and the investment splurge continued, leading to billions of dollars in misallocated capital and the bankruptcy of numerous telecoms firms, including Worldcom.\nThe coronavirus panic has a familiar ring. Charts of reported Italian deaths rising vertically recall bitcoin’s trajectory a couple of years ago. Friends and contacts have taken to forwarding articles by an alarmist coronavirus commentator (not a professional epidemiologist) who boasts millions of readers and claims that his article is the only thing you’ll ever need to read, and will save lives. It’s impossible to say whether this advice is sound or not. But it certainly feels like the pandemic mirror image to the Wall Street pied pipers, such as Henry Blodget, who loudly played their tunes during the internet bubble.\nTrust the experts, we are told: Follow the data and science. If only things were that simple. During the internet and real estate bubbles, financial experts were wrong. A top hedge fund manager once complained to me that “every bubble has an academic shill.” Epidemiology, like finance, is as much art as science. A colleague and I once gathered data on every bubble we could find. Each one turned out to be different. Epidemiologists face the same problem – as they like to joke, “if you’ve seen one pandemic, you’ve seen… one pandemic.”\nBoth investors and epidemiologists face chronic uncertainty. During an epidemic, the data is always changing. Differences in climate and social behavior affect the spread of disease across geographies. This poses enormous challenges when trying to model a pandemic. Like investment strategists, epidemiologists are prone to egregious forecasting errors. In Septemb\ner 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast 1.4 million cases of Ebola in West Africa by the following January. In the end, this epidemic produced fewer than a reported 30,000 cases. An earlier CDC model anticipated a potential smallpox outbreak would result in 77 trillion deaths – as Kucharski says, both models included an unlimited number of susceptible people.\nCovid-19’s true infection rate is unknown, as outside of South Korea testing has been inadequate and no antibody test is yet available. China cannot be trusted to provide accurate data. As for the fatality rate, Italians may be recording deaths due to coronavirus when other illnesses may also be prevalent. Last week Imperial College predicted more than 2 million people would die in the United States and half a million in the United Kingdom if Covid-19 was not suppressed. Imperial’s dire warning persuaded the U.S. and UK governments into draconian action, shuttering large swathes of the economy. On Monday, Boris Johnson locked down Great Britain.\nYet the assumptions in Imperial’s model – the reproduction rate, fatality rate, etc. – are at best educated guesses. The model’s predictions must be hugely sensitive to slight changes in a variety of inputs. Even Imperial admits that what it calls “conservative” assumptions are pessimistic. Such pessimism, or call it excessive caution, appears to be the institutional bias of epidemiologists, just as finance types are prone to hyper-optimism.\nDissenting forces can be heard through the noise. Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis states that analysis of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests the virus is much less of a danger to life than commonly assumed. Also drawing on the cruise experience, Michael Levitt, the Stanford biophysicist and Nobel laureate, makes a similar point. “What we need to control is the panic,” Levitt told the Los Angeles Times. “We’re going to be fine.”\nThis calls to mind Franklin D. Roosevelt’s words to the American people in his first inaugural address at the depth of the Great Depression in 1933: “The only thing we have to fear is... fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” When the history of this pandemic is written, it may become a postscript to the ever-expanding volume, “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”, first published in 1841.\n"}, {"content": "Sensex rises by 227 pts, Nifty back at 12,200.

Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first death toll was\nthe treatment of patients with some severe pre-existing conditions. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.

Wuhan coronavirus (2019-ncov) is spreading rapidly in Southeast Asia. So far, more than 50 cases have been confirmed, which is the most seriously affected area in the world. However, not all environmental countries, most of which have precarious health systems, rely heavily on China's tourism and investment, and respond quickly. The situation in Thailand and other places is particularly worrying. Thailand is the country most seriously affected after 19 infectious diseases. In the case of the Philippines, the first death outside the Asian power was announced on Sunday: a 44 year old Chinese man.\nWhen announcing the international emergency of the spread of coronavirus on Thursday, the director general of the World Health Organization (who), tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, warned: \"although the number of infected people outside China is relatively small, there may be a greater outbreak, As of February 2, 304 people died and more than 14000 people were infected worldwide. He explained that the decision was largely based on the need to protect countries \"without means of control\".\nSoutheast Asia is a key region in this regard. However, while declaring a state of emergency means coordinating an international response within the framework of who, in some cases, possible further action may be late. There are 19 infectious diseases in Thailand: one is a Thai taxi driver who drove to four other affected people from Hubei Province (Wuhan, the capital of the province, is the center of the virus).\nThe local infectious diseases also occurred in Japan, causing the biggest concern of the Thai authorities: the outbreak in places with a large influx of Chinese tourists. Tanarak plipat, deputy director of Thailand's Ministry of disease control, warned: \"it can be transmitted locally and then at the provincial level.\". If you consider, according to Thursday's report, about 10000 tourists from Wuhan are still in Thailand, this possibility is not far away. Last Friday, China chartered the first plane to repatriate them.\nThailand has been criticized by the public for its crisis management. In recent days, the spam government has become one of the most popular tags on twitter. Reason: dissatisfied with the measures taken by the authorities, the authorities did not begin to install thermal imaging inspection for all flights from China until the middle of last week. For many netizens, China will give priority to protecting the arrival of Chinese tourists rather than public health. Thailand's tourism industry accounts for 12% to 20% of GDP and is China's first overseas tourism destination. The country estimates that the loss is between 2.2 billion and 2.9 billion euros due to the recession of China's tourism industry.\nIn addition to the increase or decrease in the capacity and willingness to implement control measures, the instability of health systems in many countries in the region is another concern. \"We don't know what damage this virus will cause if it spreads in a country with weak health system,\" said the director general of who. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. One case discovered so far, coupled with China's insufficient investment in health care, which has doubled in recent years, and another almost insurmountable obstacle: the reluctance of Chinese Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\"If the prime minister doesn't wear a mask, why does he wear the rest,\" he declared this week. Hun Sen added that \"the real disease is fear\". He ruled out canceling flights from China to avoid damaging the damaged national economy.\nGeography is another risk factor. Unlike Russia, which announced its closure on Thursday, the land borders of countries bordering China in the region (Vietnam has three infected people, and Myanmar and Laos have no pathogens for the time being) are still open. Indonesia, an archipelago with more than 17000 islands, is monitoring two possible infectious diseases and ensuring that controls are strengthened at its numerous entry points.\nAs far as he is concerned, although P\nSingapore is the first country in Southeast Asia to take the most stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. All tourists to China have been banned from entering the country in the past two weeks. The number of cases is increasing every day, reaching 18 on February 2. Two of them were Singaporean women who were repatriated from Wuhan last Thursday.\nUntil a few days ago, there was no such pathogen in the Philippines. The Philippines was the first country outside China to register the death of coronavirus: a 44 year old Chinese citizen arrived from Wuhan with his wife and was also infected with coronavirus. At present, this is the only two cases in the country. A few hours before the death confirmation, the country announced a ban on all travel from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao.\nAs China is the main source of most Southeast Asian tourists, restricting the entry of Chinese citizens has dealt a serious blow to its economy. Malaysia has eight infected people. It rejected a controversial public request to prohibit all Chinese citizens from entering the country.\nTherefore, tourism has become a double-edged sword in Southeast Asia. According to the estimation of capital economics, a consulting firm, the number of Chinese people traveling abroad was 10 times higher than that in 2003. At that time, another coronavirus SARS appeared in China. Although it is considered to be the main source of infectious diseases, the importance of the industry in the region does not seem to encourage drastic decisions.\n"}, {"content": "singapore leaders stand in solidarity with china over covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE – Singapore leaders on Monday (Feb 24) said the country stands in solidarity with the Chinese people during the Covid-19 outbreak. \n The coronavirus has killed more than 2,500 people in China and infected more than 75,000. On Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the outbreak is the country’s largest-ever public health emergency since 1949. \n Singapore President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sent their condolences to those who lost loved ones during the outbreak.  \n In her letter to Mr Xi, Madam Halimah commended his “swift, decisive and comprehensive measures” to contain the Covid-19 outbreak and safeguard the health of the Chinese people. \n “These measures are beginning to yield encouraging and positive outcomes. I am confident that under your able leadership, China will overcome Covid-19 with strength and fortitude,” Mdm Halimah said. \n Shortly after the outbreak started in Wuhan, the Chinese government moved to contain the spread of the virus, such as shutting down transport links in and out of the city. It also built hospitals in days to treat patients. \n “We have seen how speedily China has mobilised itself to contain the spread, and implemented practical measures to help people affected, both in Wuhan and the rest of China,” Mr Lee wrote in his letter to Mr Xi. \n \"We applaud China’s firm and decisive response, and are happy to see early indications that it is beginning to bring the outbreak under control. \n \"I am confident that with your leadership, and the support of the Chinese people and the international community, China will succeed in this urgent task.\" \n INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION \n During the lockdown, several nations, including Singapore, airlifted its citizens back to their home countries. \n “I would also like to express my appreciation to the Chinese government – in particular the Hubei government – for its facilitation of Singapore’s efforts to repatriate our nationals and their dependents from Hubei,” wrote Mdm Halimah. \n “I am also glad that we were able to assist with the repatriation of Chinese nationals in Singapore back to Wuhan. This is a testament to the strong cooperation between our countries.” \n Mr Lee said China and Singapore \"cooperated closely\" on the repatriation of each other's nationals. \n He said Singapore has been affected by the coronavirus and has introduced restrictions and stepped up detection at its borders. \n \"We have implemented strict quarantine procedures. And we have strengthened our healthcare system, to treat and care for those who have contracted the virus. Many Covid-19 patients, including a significant number of Chinese citizens, have recovered well in our hospitals and been discharged,\" he wrote. \n \"Singapore is cooperating with China on multiple levels. Our shared experience fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) in 2003 taught us that countries have to work with one another to deal with a global public health crisis.\" \n The Prime Minister also noted that while there are similarities between Covid-19 and Sars, there are also \"significant differences\".  \n \"The scientists report that Covid-19 is probably more infectious than Sars, but less lethal. Consequently, it may take longer to bring under control, and is more likely to become endemic in human populations,\" he said. \n MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DONATIONS \n Mdm Halimah added that the Singapore Government has contributed medical equipment, supplies and diagnostic test kits for Covid-19, as well as seed money to a humanitarian fund which has already raised more than S$6 million. \n “I hope that our modest contributions have brought some comfort and relief to those affected by the virus,” she said. \n Mr Lee also noted that Singapore had responded to China's early request for personal protective equipment, medical supplies and diagnostic test kits. \n Mdm Halimah said international cooperation is \"crucial to effectively combatting Covid-19\". \n \"It is to China’s credit that its willingness to work with the international community has allowed us all, including affected countries like Singapore, to develop test kits and come up with appropriate measures to manage the outbreak together,\" she added. \n Mr Lee said Singapore researchers are ready to collaborate with their Chinese counterparts and share their expertise to work towards a vaccine and treatment for the coronavirus. \n \"I am happy that Deputy Prime Minis\nter Heng Swee Keat and Vice Premier Han Zheng have agreed to discuss cooperation in the management of public health crises at the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC),\" Mr Lee added. \n Singapore is also cooperating on a regional basis with China and other neighbouring countries to counter the outbreak, as seen in the recent Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on Covid-19 in Vientiane. \n “Even as countries take strong measures to contain the disease in the early phases, we should begin exploring how over the longer term we can best manage the health effects of the virus on our people, while progressively restoring economic activities and international trade and travel,” said Mr Lee. \n “Singapore has some ideas, which my Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan shared with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi when they met in Laos last week. Our officials can discuss this further.” \n Singapore and China are marking the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year. Mr Lee said the two countries’ close cooperation in meeting common challenges such as Covid-19 testifies to their \"strong and steadfast friendship\". \n “I send my best wishes for your continued success, and look forward to meeting you again soon to discuss these and other issues,” he said. \n Mdm Halimah said: \"I am confident that with your strong support, our two countries will continue to build on this firm foundation to further deepen and broaden the multifaceted cooperation between our two countries.\" CNA \n For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.\n"}, {"content": "struggling hong kong airlines sacks 170 staff, day after it ditches food, drink, blankets and pillows from flights. HONG KONG — Hong Kong Airlines started sacking staff on Wednesday (Feb 19), a day after slashing in-flight services to a bare minimum. \n Sources told the South China Morning Post that 170 employees, mostly flight attendants, had been informed that Wednesday would be their last day of work. \n On Tuesday night, the airline said that, starting the next day, it would cut a host of services on all flights, including providing food, drink, pillows and blankets, in what it said was a “precautionary measure” to protect customers and crew during the coronavirus outbreak. \n However, the Post has been told the move is a desperate attempt to cut costs by an airline which was on the brink of collapse at the beginning of the year, and two weeks ago announced it was making 400 staff redundant. \n The measures came after earlier reductions to services, which only affected flights to mainland China. \n In a notice one employee received, the airline said: “We regret to inform you that based on the company’s recent review of its operational requirements, you will be made redundant.” \n Flight attendants would be paid an extra month, plus accrued but unused annual leave, while severance based on years of service would be taken into account. \n The termination notice ended: “We would like to thank you for your contribution to the company in the past and we sincerely wish you all the best in your future endeavours.” \n Affected staff have been told to hand back their uniforms on Thursday. \n Unable to pay for in-flight entertainment since December, passengers will need to bring their own devices or reading material to keep themselves entertained with magazines scrapped, while the carrier closed its flagship airport lounge at Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday. \n “To further strengthen our precautionary measures and reduce the risk of our crew and customers from being potentially exposed to coronavirus, Hong Kong Airlines will be limiting in-flight cabin activity and making temporary adjustments to our on-board services,” the company said on its website. \n The airline apologised for the inconvenience to customers and said it would continue to monitor the situation and make further in-flight changes accordingly. The airline’s older lounge in the main terminal of the airport remains open. \n There would be no particular restrictions on passengers bringing food or drink on board, the airline added. \n A fortnight ago, Hong Kong Airlines said at least 400 of its 3,500 staff would be made redundant while all other staff would be required to take unpaid leave between mid-February until the end of June, amounting to a total of two months, or work part-time on half pay. \n Passengers in business class will only receive a bottle of water, while economy travellers will only get a pre-packed cup of water. No food will be provided on flights, and magazines have been axed, except newspapers or reading materials in seat pockets. \n For more than a year, Hong Kong Airlines has faced lingering questions about its ability to keep operating. \n Last December, the government allowed the company to stay in business after a last-minute cash injection — blamed on the months of civil unrest in Hong Kong, during which fewer people visited the city. \n The coronavirus, which causes a deadly disease known as Covid-19, has pushed the airline once again to the brink of its existence.

We will wait calmly for hospitalization and for the examinations to be carried out\". said Grace Freitas, who advanced that the cases were validated by the authorities within the two hours prior to the press conference, which began at 19:00.\nOne of the cases validated for investigation is that of a man who was a contact of the group of German citizens infected in the course of a training in Germany, given by a company official who travelled from China for this purpose.\nThe Director-General of Health explained that the 40-year-old Portuguese citizen was placed under surveillance on his return to Portugal and that it was the monitoring system that allowed early detection of symptoms.\nFor the two cases now under investigation, the results of clinical analyses should be known in the next few hours, referred Grace Freitas.\nRegarding the repetition of the analyses to the 20-person voluntary group following the repatriation of Wuhan, Archbishop Freitas said that this will take place \"in due course\" and \"at the time when experts consider it more appropriate to do according to the best evidence available\".\n\"It will not be before 72 hours,\" said Grace Freitas, in reference to the time when the first analysis was made.\nIt also added that the case of the Belgian patient travelling on the same plane does not alter the risk assessment.\nRegarding the group under quarantine, the Secretary of State for Health stressed that \"they are well and quiet, asymptomatic and well-disposed\" and that Portugal continues to register no confirmed case of infection.\nOn the meeting that took place today with 20 institutional experts from the National Health Council, which Antonio Sales considered to have been'positive and important', no conclusions were drawn, but the'importance of maintaining good communication, avoiding unnecessary panic situations, while maintaining the necessary vigilance was strengthened'.\nGrace Freitas also left an \"appeal to the common sense\" of the Portuguese, asking them not to discriminate against Asian citizens or Asian people, reminding them that all people can travel freely, whenever they want and wherever they want. These two new cases raise to four suspicious cases in Portugal, the first two had negative results and the new ones will now be subject to clinical and epidemiological tests.\nThe first case was reported to 26 in January in a man returned from China who was under observation at Curry Cabral Hospital on suspicion of infection with the new virus found in that country and the second was with a foreign national who was admitted to St John's Hospital in Porto on January 31.\nThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which emerged last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, central China, has already caused 426 dead and infected over 20.400 people.\nIn addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of confirmed infection in 24 other countries.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) dec\nLast Thursday, an international public health emergency arose.

No,” Mourinho told a news conference on Tuesday. “My relationship with my players is good and I love to work with my group. And that’s it.”\nMourinho said Rose was left out at the weekend due to a back injury, with young centre half Japhet Tanganga filling in at left back at Vicarage Road.\n“The reason why he wasn’t selected against Middlesbrough is because we have\na young left back that we want to develop and it was a great opportunity to play (Ryan) Sessegnon,” he added.\n“Also because his (Rose’s) performance against Liverpool was not phenomenal.\n“Then on the Thursday... I got a call from my medical staff saying Danny was calling them with a problem in his back and he wouldn’t train the next day.\n“It was a bit of a surprise that on the Friday he was ready to train, but even so I decided then to play with Tanganga and have Ryan on the bench. That is the situation.”\nMourinho also said Inter Milan target Christian Eriksen has not played his last match for Spurs and that the Danish playmaker will be in the squad for Wednesday’s match against Norwich City.\nThe Portuguese coach will also welcome back club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele, who has not played since the defeat by Southampton on New Year’s Day due to a hip problem.\n“I am confident (he can have a run of games) but let’s see,” Mourinho said.\n“We know what he can give to the team.

US researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.\nWith a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe.\n\"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\"\nThe Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart.\n\"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot.\nShe's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study.\nAfter the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\"\nMonday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health.\nStill, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\"\nThis vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself.\nIt's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against Covid-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the US, China and South Korea -- next month.\nThe Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.\nCovid-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other.\nStarting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the US struck early and hard by the virus.\nStill, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP.\nSome of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.\n\"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\" Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\"\nMost of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected.\nResearchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine.\nThe idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the rea\nl virus.\nThat's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it.\nBut because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate.\n\"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week.\nThe Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before Covid-19 began spreading widely in Washington state.\nKaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of Covid-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus. Finland confirms first case of infection with the new coronavirus.

These charges are likely to be waived.\nDemurrage charges are levied by shipping lines on importers when they do not take delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or the terminal area within the permissible number of free days.\nHowever, with China on shutdown mode, many companies are looking at India as an alternative destination.\n“Some 10-12 companies, among those searching for alternatives to China, have spoken to us, and I feel their expectations from us are quite realistic and reasonable,” said Sitharaman.\nThe finance minister is scheduled to meet industry bodies and trade leaders, including those from the tourism sector, about the coronavirus threat on Tuesday.\nShe decided on these interactions after a recent meeting in Chennai, where importers flagged their concerns.\nThe government expects to earn Rs 1.25 trillion from Customs duty in 2019-20, according to Revised Estimates, down 19 per cent from last year’s Budget numbers.\nAjay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said any relaxation in submission of documents for imports purpose would be highly beneficial as statutory agencies have not yet commenced their full operation.\nMeanwhile, officials from finance, commerce and other ministries are also expected to meet stakeholders to find ways on managing the coronavirus fallout.\nFor instance, Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal said he would hold meetings with industry segments over the next week to strategise on overcoming the supply shortage by scaling up domestic production.\n“We are going to look at ways where we can rework the global supply chain with the help of domestic manufacturers… We are also talking to other countries. It is a big opportunity for us,” Sanyal told Business Standard.\nTo address the supply crunch, CII has suggested leveraging the existing excess capacity in the Indian industry; rolling back import duty hike to look for alternative sources of imports; expanding credit to manufacturing units with quick loan sanctions, and one-time emergency waiver o\nf non-performing asset regulations for three months.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus shocks financial markets.\nIt was only in the financial markets that the worry about the Coronavirus was lifted, but that is now over.

Apple, for example, recently collected its sales forecast for the current quarter due to supply shortages on iPhones. On Monday also the British mixed company AB Foods warned against In Germany, according to BDI, among other things, the electrical, automotive, pharmaceutical and paper industries are expecting bottlenecks in supplies from the Far East.\nAn additional problem, according to expert Nielsen, is that central banks cannot respond to such supply shocks.

Perhaps it’s cabin fever — Singaporeans are getting antsy working from home, frustrated with cancelled holiday plans in the face of tightening travel restrictions. Or mayhap, complacency has set in. The world’s medical community has, after all, touted the Singaporean government’s rigorous measures against the spread of Covid-19 as the gold standard for keeping the disease in check. Whatever it is, our island this past weekend was not the ghost town it resembled a month ago after the Dorscon Orange alert was sounded. It was jam-packed everywhere we went: at a kopitiam in Upper Serangoon, a mom-and-pop bakery in Tiong Bahru, a chic new restaurant on Purvis Street, a Chinese fine-diner in Orchard Road, a Yakun outlet in Ion Orchard, and the food basement at Takashimaya. All were thronged with people as if it were 2019 during the Great Singapore Sale, back when we weren’t in the thick of, you know, a pandemic.  \n The government has advised Singaporeans to practise social distancing. What is social distancing, you ask? The idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people — in this case, at least six feet (about two metres). That also means minimising contact with people, says The New York Times. This is important as there is no vaccine for Covid-19 yet, and social distancing is the only thing that works in lessening the spread of the disease now. China’s drastic drop in new cases within the virus’s epicenter in Wuhan is proof enough that this method has its merits.  \n “I think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You should not sound the all-clear,” warns Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan in an interview with CNBC. Sage advice, especially when our neighbour, Malaysia, announced last night that it will enforce a “restricted movement order”, which bans citizens from going overseas and foreigners from entering the country for roughly two weeks starting 18 March. The lockdown is in response to a sharp spike of cases in Malaysia. Meanwhile, the disease has brought Europe to its knees, with Italy having an alarming number of deaths that are already half of China’s total. American cities like New York have shut down schools, theatres, bars and even restaurants. Some speculate that the virus may soon blow up in the rest of South East Asia, where a lot of testing is done haphazardly at best — our country has seen a few imported cases from Indonesia, and it has since imposed restrictions on medical tourists trying to seek treatment here.  \n Singaporeans know all of this.

With health experts’ advice to maintain a two-metre (some say four) gap between strangers ringing in our head, we pointedly gave a wide berth between ourselves and the lady in front. Our efforts were soon scuppered when an auntie rushed up behind us, invading our personal space like a nosy mother who flings open her teenage son’s bedroom door at midnight without knocking. We stepped away in an attempt to put some distance between us. She inched closer. We strode ahead again and she shadowed us once more like a bad movie sequel. Rinse and miserably repeat. “Hey auntie, do you mind not standing so close please?” we finally blurted, not caring if we sounded like a paranoid germophobe (we’d rather be safe than sorry). To her credit, she backtracked quickly, darting her eyes nervously around. We relaxed a little. Soon, it was our turn to order at the cake counter. As we fumbled for cash, we felt someone with clammy skin brushing up against us. Hello again, auntie. In her haste, she probably thought skin-to-skin contact would result in faster service. We damn near sprinted out of the shop. “You should’ve faked a coughing fit, everyone in the queue would’ve definitely steered clear,” jokes a friend after we related this harrowing tale.  \n   \n  \n The retro bakery is famous for its yummy white coconut kueh dadar. \n 8days.sg reader A.

Coincidentally, she did not ‘infect’ her purchases but instead aimed her cough behind her [at me] — no social responsibility. I later binned the bread for peace of mind. My family and friends told me I shouldn't have paid for it and should have gotten new ones, but everything took place in a short span of time and in hindsight, it might have been for the best so that the possibly germy bread wouldn’t make its way back to the shelf.” How ghastly.

As we waited to be served, we felt an unholy gust of wind against the back of our neck. As we swivelled to find its source, a middle-aged guy with his mug several inches from ours bellowed in Mandarin: “I want spicy anchovies!” We recoiled in horror and glared at him. He jerked back almost comically, embarrassed realisation creeping up on his face as he acknowledged he did a totally uncool thing in the time of Covid-19. The irony? He was wearing a surgical mask — but it was pulled down to reveal his nose and mouth. It stared at us mockingly from the depths of his chin. As if our nerves weren't already frayed enough, the shop assistant then coughed very lightly as she scooped up our anchovies. She may have done this through a mask, but it looked rather flimsy. We get that she couldn't cover her mouth because her hands were busy scooping up our food and that her throat probably tickled so uncontrollably she couldn't help herself — but perhaps turn the other way? Needless to say, we changed our mind about wanting those little fish after all. On a brighter note, the sour & spicy kimchi that we finally tapowed home was pretty appetising.  \n Even upmarket cafes like Bacha Coffee in Ion Orchard, which is like a glittering java version of TWG’s swish teahouses, didn’t have a single empty seat last Sunday afternoon. There was a mid-length but tightly-packed line of people waiting to enter the busy dining room. \n   \n   \n Why do some restaurants still do this when every single thing you put into your mouth is met with suspicion these days? It’s gross even pre-Covid-19, quite irresponsible now. At the two trendy new restaurants we visited last week, we asked for serving spoons for communal dishes. Both times, the waiters simply left the cutlery resting on our bare table. One of them also used a musty-smelling cloth to wipe said table just minutes earlier. Ideally, eateries should place silverware onto plates, wrap them up in napkins, or only provide them directly to the diner when their food is served.  \n   \n Go out if you must — small F&B businesses in particular need your love during this difficult period. But do so wisely: avoid overcrowded places, maintain a safe distance from strangers where possible, keep your person to yourself (no brushing up against people, please). And for the love of all things that are good, cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands immediately after. Do your part to help flatten the curve and protect not just yourself, but loved ones who’re vulnerable to the virus. Can’t or won’t do it? Then it’s far safer to endure cabin fever at home instead of being struck down with one of the viral kind. Photos: Florence Fong\n"}, {"content": "Athletes unite to fight common rival. DUBLIN • Conor McGregor, the biggest draw in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has spent €1 million (S$1.58 million) on protective equipment for hospital staff members treating patients infected by the coronavirus in Ireland. \n The mixed martial arts star sent a message to Ireland's Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, and revealed the contents on his Twitter page on Wednesday night. \n Donohoe had written to his fellow Irishman, asking him to tell his 7.9 million social media followers to practise social distancing. \n \"Today I am purchasing myself, one million euros worth of personal protective equipment to be deployed to all the fighting hospitals in the Leinster region.

Spain is the second-most affected country in Europe after Italy, with over 56,000 cases and 4,089 deaths. \n While the epicentre of the outbreak has shifted from China to Europe, Wuhan was where the disease originated. Last month, retired Chinese tennis star Li Na, the only Asian player to win two Grand Slam singles titles, donated 3 million yuan (S$608,500) to support the efforts in suppressing Covid-19 in her hometown. \n The Poland striker has given €1 million to a campaign called \"We Kick Corona\", which was set up by Bayern Munich teammates Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich. It aims to assist frontline healthcare workers to limit the spread of the virus in Germany, which has been badly affected, with almost 40,000 cases and 222 deaths. \n The Tottenham forward is back in London after undergoing surgery for a broken arm, which he suffered last month.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy’s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, the government’s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty.

The Thai and Korean currencies, exposed to China via tourism and goods exports respectively, are also taking a battering.  \n Growth forecast downgrades for China, the world's No. 2 economy, are coming thick and fast, meaning estimates for other countries are being reworked too.

Nothing could be further from the truth,\" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \"WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\"\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties.

For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\nHealth authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation.

The deaths to be recorded have also increased to 2236. And worry comes from where you don't always expect it. In prisons, there are already 500 cases confirmed by the country.

By Muhammad Saufee RosmanKUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 -- When a small outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, on Dec 31, last year, nobody expected it to cause a public health emergency of international concern or PHEIC.In just a month, the new strain of coronavirus had infected over 11,000 people in 24 countries, with 213 deaths reported in China alone. No death was reported outside the republic.World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2019-nCoV situation as a PHEIC at a press conference in Geneva on Thursday, saying that the greatest concern now is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.Malaysia, which has also recorded eight imported cases of infection caused by the 2019-nCoV involving Chinese nationals, has also taken various proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus which causes pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties, in the country.“Malaysia welcomes the (WHO’s) declaration and has been on high alert and strengthening the surveillance in all of our international entry points even before the PHEIC was announced,” Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said.As at noon today, the number of confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in Malaysia remained at eight, while the cumulative number of patients under investigation (PUI) for coronavirus infection is 142, with six awaiting laboratory test results.The number of individuals who have had close contact with coronavirus positive cases remains at 32, he said, adding that the patient who was reported to have fled from hospital while waiting for laboratory test results, had been picked up and confirmed negative for 2019-nCoV.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad in a statement today also said that Malaysia is leading the ASEAN Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) network and actively engaging with the ASEAN member states on 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation updates and data sharing to promote detection response and communication to prevent the spread of the virus.“We (Malaysia) are on top and in control of all these things,” he stressed.Four of the eight Chinese nationals tested positive for 2019-nCoV in Malaysia are receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital, three at Permai Hospital in Johor, and one in Sultanah Maliha Hospital in Langkawi. All of them are reported stable and recovering well.The government’s proactive action in tackling the health issue also involved the evacuation of Malaysian citizens from Wuhan.According to Malaysian Ambassador to China, Raja Datuk Nushirwan Zainal Abidin, discussions with China regarding the evacuation of Malaysians were going well and those involved were expected to return on commercial flights soon.He said the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing had also sent an advance team to Wuhan to coordinate and assist in the process of bringing back 120 Malaysians in Hubei province.“The team will locate and update the list of Malaysians there for the purpose of repatriation later,” he said.The government’s quick action in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection in the country had also received praise from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah.His Majesty said the government, however, has to continuously undertake precautionary measures, not compromising on issues affecting the well-being of the people and the country.Al-Sultan Abdullah also reminded the people to cooperate with the government in implementing preventive measures to stop the coronavirus from spreading further.-- BERNAMA\n"}, {"content": "Novel coronavirus named 'Covid-19': UN health agency.

HONG KONG — A 65-year-old Chinese woman who fell seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus made a startling recovery after being given stem cell therapy, according to a new study by Chinese scientists. \n The patient had been fighting for her life in the intensive care unit at Baoshan Hospital in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan province, for nearly two weeks after contracting Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. \n But according to a paper published by a team of researchers from Kunming University led by Dr Hu Min, just four days after being given her first shot of umbilical cord stem cells, the woman was back on her feet and able to walk. \n \"Although only one case was shown here, it could be very important and inspire similar clinical practices in treating critically ill Covid-19 patients,\" said the study, which was published on Thursday (Feb 27) on Chinaxiv.org, a platform for the release of scientific papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n The treatment \"might be an ideal choice to be used or combined with other immune modulating agents\", it said. \n The Yunnan case is one of 14 trials using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) clinical trial database. While the technology remains controversial, there is hope among health authorities and medical professionals that it could become a lifesaver for critically ill patients. \n The patient in Kunming arrived in the city on Jan 21 on a flight from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. A week later she fell ill with a mild fever, fatigue and coughing, so went to a public hospital where she tested positive for Covid-19. From there she was transferred to Baoshan Hospital. \n Following the strict guidelines laid down by the government for the treatment of coronavirus patients, doctors there first administered antiviral medications and antibiotics, and put the woman — who also suffers from type 2 diabetes — on oxygen to help her breathe. Her condition improved initially but then went rapidly downhill and she was moved to the intensive care unit on Feb 1. \n Things did not improve, and as the woman's health worsened and her organs began to fail, the doctors needed to act fast. So, after consulting the hospital's ethics committee and the patient's family, the stem cell therapy was started on Feb 9. \n Stem cells are highly adaptive early-stage cells that evolve into different types of fully functioning cells to produce tissue, organs or body fluids. The ones used in the Kunming study came from a laboratory culture of umbilical cords from newborn babies. \n The doctors considered using stem cell therapy because Covid-19 has been shown in other studies to cause severe damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Tests conducted on animals suggested stem cells might be able to repair that damage. \n According to the paper, the Kunming patient was given the first of three shots on Feb 9. After showing no adverse effects to that initial dose she was given a second three days later. On Feb 13, she was able to get out of bed and take a short walk with only limited help. \n She was given her final shot on Feb 15, and two days later was able to leave the intensive care unit and go back to a regular ward. Her vital signs had returned to normal and a throat swab test for Covid-19 came back negative. \n According to Dr Li Honghui, who is involved in similar trials at Loudi Central Hospital in central China's Hunan province, stem cell injections can deliver significant results within three days. \n \"We cannot stick to the rules, we must be bold and innovative,\" he was quoted as saying in a report by Hunan Daily last week. \n Mr Zhang Xinmin, director of biological technology at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing, told a press conference on February 15 that the preliminary results of stem cell experiments conducted across the country suggested the technology was \"safe and effective\". \n Hospitals in Huanggang, one of the worst hit cities in Hubei, received their first shipment of stem cell shots last week and they would be given to three critically ill patients, state media reported. \n Another paper published on Chinaxiv on Friday said that seven coronavirus patients in Beijing had been given stem cell therapy and responded in a similar way to\nthe woman in Kunming. \n Stem cell technology emerged in the 1980s but remains highly controversial. Scientists initially considered using human embryos as the source for the cells, but the idea drew fire on ethical grounds. \n The research community responded by proposing alternative methods for harvesting stem cells, such as turning normal tissue cells into stem cells, but those efforts were tarnished by a series of scandals in the United States, Japan and South Korea involving the fabrication of experimental data. \n In China, scientists are engaged in cutting edge research on stem cells. While the use of cells from healthy embryos is forbidden, scientists are permitted to use fertilised eggs discarded due to illness or defects. \n A doctor treating coronavirus patients in Beijing, who asked not to be named, said there was a growing discussion within the medical community about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy. \n \"The stem cell industry may have some vested interest to promote their technology in this crisis, but if it really works, it should be made available to more patients,\" she said.

The medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic.\nIts true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the United States' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week.\nMost people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems.\nThat's a huge number, said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads a global health organization. In the U.S., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more.\n\"There's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, COVID-19, he said.\nHOW IT SPREADS\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by U.S. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face.\nThe virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.\n\"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests.\nThe risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.\nHOW FAST DOES IT SPREAD?\nEach infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nMost people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on.\nIn a report last week on the first 12 patients in the U.S., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness.\nIn China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.\nChildren seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?\nSome cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.\n\"It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home.\nHowever, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\"\nWHAT'S THE TEST LIKE?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back.\nIt's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nSome areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.\nWHEN IS THE VIRUS MO\nST CONTAGIOUS?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms.\nSigns of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn.\n\"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"\nHOW DEADLY IS IT?\nThat won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms.\nScientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location.\nFlu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.\nThe death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the U.S., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure.\nCAN INFECTED PEOPLE WHO RECOVER GET IT AGAIN?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place.\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\nFauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.\n\"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"\nWILL IT GO AWAY IN THE SUMMER?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor.\n\"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said.\nBut that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.\nFlu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\"\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Athletes advised to avoid China if possible.

TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan who refused to undergo tests for the new coronavirus have set off a political quandary in Japan over the evacuation mission, with debate centred on how the human rights of a minority should not supersede a potential health menace to society. \n The two, who were among 206 nationals on Japan's first chartered flight out of the epicentre of the 2019-nCOV outbreak which landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Wednesday, had displayed no symptoms at the airport and were \"escorted home\" after refusing to undergo further tests. Their actions came as three new cases of the virus were identified from the evacuees. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had to step in to calm nerves on Thursday (Jan 30). \n \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so,\" Mr Abe told the Diet, as Japan's Parliament is known. \"There are some areas that the government is reluctant to forcefully step in because it encroaches on human rights. But from the second flight we should see how we can properly confirm the health status of all evacuees.\" \n He stressed: \"We will do our utmost to protect the lives and health of the people, and we will make decisions without hesitation.\" \n While the new Wuhan virus has been named a \"designated infectious disease\" in Japan under a special law, it only allows the authorities to make compulsory the hospitalisation of confirmed patients. \n This issue has flared up in Japan, stirring debate among Twitter users, who argue that upholding the human rights of two people should not be more important than averting a potential health menace to society. \n The term \"kensa kyohi\" (rejection of inspection) is trending on the social media platform, with many calling the duo irresponsible and asking for details like where they live so that they can avoid the neighbourhood. Some have gone as far as to say that they should not have been allowed on the chartered flight in the first place. \n Emotions are running high as Japan diagnosed its first cases with no visible flu symptoms on Thursday. These were among the 206 people who returned a day earlier. \n The question, of whether people who have been infected but show no symptoms can still spread the virus, remains unresolved. \n Among the 206, five had been immediately warded upon landing after they reported having a fever and cough. None subsequently tested positive for the Wuhan bug. \n Of the other 199 who had agreed to further tests at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), seven were hospitalised after flu symptoms were confirmed. \n Among these seven, one 2019-nCOV case was found: a man in his 50s who had a runny nose and a sore throat. He subsequently developed a 38.7 deg C fever. \n And among the remaining 191, two cases, a man and a woman in their 40s, had displayed no visible symptoms and were identified only through NIID tests. They have been quarantined. \n Meanwhile, a second chartered flight, carrying 210 Japanese citizens, landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Thursday. Of these, 13 people who had fever or cough have been hospitalised, public broadcaster NHK reported. Another 300 people who are still stranded in Wuhan want to return to Japan, the Foreign Ministry said. At least one more chartered flight is being planned. \n Further, an Osaka tour guide in her 40s has also tested positive for the 2019-nCOV virus. The tour guide had worked with a previously-identified case - a Japanese bus driver in his 50s who lives in Nara prefecture - in leading a group of tourists from Wuhan from Jan 12 to 17. The group travelled from Narita Airport, to the east of Tokyo, to Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Both cases have no recent travel history to the virus-hit central Chinese city, and the Health Ministry said they were likely infected when travelling with the group of tourists. \n The government is doing urgent contact tracing to identify any people who have come in close contact with the tour group, including in Yamanashi prefecture near Mount Fuji and in Osaka. \n Japan now has a total of 11 confirmed cases of the virus.\n"}, {"content": "New virus in China: Cases in Europe are also becoming more likely.\nAfter the increase in the number of patients in China, experts believe that individual incursions of the new lung disease into Europe are more and more likely.

Within five days, since Saturday, the number of infected with the new coronavirus in Europe has skyrocketed from five dozen to more than 450; Number of dead ones one to 14. And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in Sao Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. This has entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading more rapidly around the world than in China.\nEven if the acceleration of the outbreak is causing concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for the moment, cause for panic: the EU has again ensured on Tuesday that it is working \"on all fronts\" to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of the Member States \"in real time\" to tackle a phenomenon that is \"dynamic\".\nThe European Commission has reinforced that the key is for the EU as a whole to be \"ready\" for a possible increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and in terms of containing the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues linked to increased cases, particularly the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has emphasised is not within its competence, but that of each Member State. However, such a scenario is not discarded either.\nItaly is the country most concerned by the European health authorities. This is because there has been a sudden increase in positive cases since Friday: only three people infected with the virus were accounted for on that day, but that number has since risen to 400 infected. This Wednesday was also confirmed as the twelfth victim in the country.\nThe Italian authorities are increasingly trying to tighten the siege on Covid-19: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where around fifty thousand people live throughout the entire weekend are still in force. V, Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy are the critical regions located in the red zone.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nAfter Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but without new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died at dawn in Paris after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece have also confirmed new cases of infection.\nSo far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh o, the crewman of a cruise ship who was admitted to a Japanese hospital in Okazaki, about thirty miles from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday were 18) were negative.\nThe virus that has already made more than 2760 dead (most of them in China) is now spreading at the highest speed around the world and there are already people infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan.\nThis Wednesday, China reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while reporting 406 new cases, most in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus recorded a fall of 20%, compared to Monday, for example. According to the updated data by the Chinese National Health Commission, the country is adding more than 2700 dead and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among the infected, more than 45 thousand were still active and more than 8500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost half a thousand people have already been released.\nAlthough Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China, 139 cases of infection have been reported only last week and 19 people have died, President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to quarantine cities and districts of the country.\nHowever, the authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to extending this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite sacred sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries already \"enc\nhave missed their land and air borders with Iran (neighbouring Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such a s Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia).\nAvoiding panic is one of the key messages from the World Health Organisation (WHO): the organisation's public health director, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is \"irrational and disproportionate\" that masks and disinfectants are exhausted in pharmacies for fear of coronavirus. In statements to the Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that masks are for the use of health personnel and stressed that the decrease of victims and diseases occurring in China \"may mean that the epidemic has reached the summit and reached the epidemic peak\". On the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China, warned that the planet is \"not ready\" to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus.\nAs for the preparation of our country, the Foreign Minister, has assured us that we are prepared for a possible entry of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva mentioned this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, it stressed that this is a global problem requiring concerted action, mainly at European level.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs already announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus.

Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this TIME ONLINE series she critically reports on life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym.\nThe Coronavirus in China has given me the most extraordinary spring break I've ever had. I read and hear from afar from empty streets in cities, little fireworks, but a lot of fear everywhere, even anger. Travel restrictions make it difficult for people to travel home to their families. The spring festivals I remember now seem to me like a dream of a hundred years ago. It fills me with almost nostalgic feelings.\nAs a Chinese immigrant I usually have much more opportunities to celebrate in Germany in winter than the Germans themselves: At Christmas and New Year's I add the Chinese Spring Festival or the Chinese New Year Festival, which starts between the end of January and mid-February with the change of year. (this time it fell on the 25th of January) The Germans, on the other hand, from January 2nd with their post-holiday depression, Easter still hardly appears as light at the end of a very long and cold tunnel. On the other hand, my holiday mood lasts one or even two months longer, because the lantern enfest takes place in mid to end of February.\nFor a Chinese girl living abroad, Chinese New Year's festivities are now a virtual thing anyway. Through the social media I have observed from afar over the past years how China comes to a complete halt in the two weeks of the Spring Festival respectively in a huge, always The eleven months of the year, which are filled with work and competition until the attack, pass into a month filled with alcohol and just as fierce family competition. The flood of travellers is then usually flooded with alcohol and the same intense family competition. n all directions across the country, it is the world's largest human hiking movement in the short term: three billion trips to family reunion were counted during the Spring Festival 2019, to land, to water or in the air the nearly 1,4 billion Chinese were travelling.\nFor Europeans, the idea of such a huge number of travellers may sound abstract, but for me, it combines the memory of an intense physical experience when I was still living in China. It always started at least a month earlier when I was fighting for tickets for plane, train and bus to Ha in time. Then the same contest, the fight for a taxi to be at the airport or train station in time; standing for at least two to three security checks, with subtle or not so subtle elbow deployment or strategic position I have the smell of all the transistors still in my nose: the mixture of strong bodies. I have the smell of all the transistors still in my nose: the mixture of strong bodies, and I have the smell of all the transistors. thinning, cheap plastic bags and worn leather, cleaning agents on marble or concrete floors, people's tension like charcoal smoke in the air.\nThe spring festivities really only started when, for example, the train started to move slowly. Relief and happiness. At the same time, the passengers on the train opened their pockets, and the scent of all kinds of food soon swept through the wagons. The less luxurious the journey was, the more food and drinks became People asked each other about their professions, families, family status and income, made appropriate sympathetic noises or gave unsolicited tips on how to deal with private problems. As a young woman, it was all moving and unsettling for me at the same time.\nIn the course of the years I have not only delicious food but also visits\nhave been offered to foreigners and even some potential husbands. However, the meeting that impressed me the most took place in a long-distance bus. A young woman in the seat next to me, barely awake from a long sleep, put her elbow on my shoulder and began brushing her hair. I behaved quietly and let myself be used as her hairdresser without resistance throughout the process. She seemed to me to be a migrant worker. Maybe she was lonely, and I was just shy. We didn't say a word.\nSince I could afford plane and express train tickets, there have been no more intimate encounters of this kind. The trips to the Spring Festival have become less challenging and much more orderly. The good mobile phone connections along the route in recent years have made it possible to listen increasingly to video and gaming noises, telephone calls and chats via social media instead of conversations between fellow travellers. What has not changed until the end is the ubiquitous smell of food. I really scared a German friend on one of my spring break trips to date when I unpacked my package of seasoned duck feet at Shanghai's express train station. This is the last remaining national pride I haven't gotten rid of.\nIt took some courage in the past to return to the homeland when young people who had moved away but had not yet definitively arrived elsewhere. In ancient China, they said the closer you get to your hometown, the more nervous you get. In the West, these mixed feelings have been familiar to people since Christmas. \"You never know what tests you will be subjected to by your parents or various relatives. We call this mixture of longing for return and fear of such attacks... Shredder Spring Festival.\" Thus it is said in the foreplay to a song that is very popular among young cities in China, Tips for self-help at the Spring Festival, sung by the Shanghai rainbow choir. The hashtag named after the song title on Douban, one of the largest social media platforms, is now also very popular, 2,5 million hits and more than a thousand tips.\nOf course, families who claim to have their children's benefits do not only exist in China, but the idea of competition and the shameless crossing of borders can be more overwhelming than in Europe: as the foreigners on the train, older relatives also like to ask about the income of the younger ones during the spring feast, according to dates and marriage plans, according to the details of birth plans, education plans for the babies, once again there are free advice without question. It is also not unusual that your weight, the length of your legs and neck, your diet, your skin are being commented on. Of course, all out of concern.\nOnce the boasting (and only outwardly) of proud parents starts, the bets are on the table. The son has been promoted, the other has a fat baby; One daughter has given her parents a luxurious apartment, the other has taken the parents on a European trip... Then it is time to give the wishes of blessing in the form of money in red envelopes (or Hongbao) to the children and the elderly. This is the final, brutal commitment: prosperity.\nIn recent years, however, the Internet empire Tencent has changed the competition in Hong Kong. At the Spring Festival 2014, Tencent has launched a new in-app service called WeChat Hongbao in his social media app WeChat. As digital payments are made everywhere, this immediately became a success: 823 million participants used the service at the Spring Festival 2019. For members of a group chat, WeChat Hongbao even offers the possibility to compete with the same Hongbao.\nWeChat has consequently changed an old Chinese custom in three respects. On the one hand, the custom in the past only dictated that money be distributed to family members; But now one is somehow obliged to think of friends and colleagues as well. Secondly, many Internet companies are now also giving their users digital Hong Kong for customer loyalty purposes. This year, the Kuaishou short film platform will transfer Hong Kong to a billion Yuan (almost 130 million euros). And dr.\nNowadays the geographical distance is no longer a reason to give up the red envelopes, which now goes from anywhere in the world, no matter where you live, and be it on the island of Palau.\nDuring the holiday week since then, many Chinese have been staring at their phones to capture some of the happiness. Soon new apps were created to help greedy people automatically access the digital envelopes of companies. I have not won a competition so far, because I have been too far away in recent years: whenever I discovered the envelopes on the screen, someone had already emptied them in China. With these false promises, it is like with distant stars in the sky: what I see is only the memory of the long past. And yet I also have to distribute my honeycombs online. Luckily WeChat has set a maximum limit for the sum of each red envelope in a chat group: 200 Yuan, about 26 euro.\nBut it is not only immigrants who are watching from afar during the spring feast. The gathering of a large, omitted crowd is the core of worldly happiness in Chinese society, but more and more people have had enough of it. Some wealthy, but also some middle-class families, today take overseas holidays to escape the noise, traffic and air pollution of China, which, for example, bring with them many fireworks during the spring feast. The countries of Southeast Asia and Japan are the favorite destinations that really prefer rich and worldly people even further corners of the planet. But wherever they flee, most of them stay connected to WeChat to post photos and videos and chat with friends and relatives. This is a slightly different spring formal contest. The further away from home you are, the better. I'm staying exactly where I am, and that's quite a feat, too.\nI started boycotting a traditional spring festival, the New Year's gala of China Central TV. This television show was created 1983 by the end of the government, the common reputation after the opulent time has long become an indispensable element of the family celebration. I grew up with it and gradually lost the taste of it when my political thinking and ethical standards changed. I learned about the stories behind the stage: the famous director who went to prison for accepting bribes; One by one, the beautiful singers became lovers of political leaders; popular comedians were thrown out of the show and were not allowed to appear on any other show because they insisted on respecting their copyrights. Ugly power games are inevitable in a show that aims to seduce and shape the souls of 1,4 billion people on New Year's Day.\nThere have been some calls this year to cancel the show due to the outbreak of the new Coronavirus. She then walked across the stage without much mention of the sick and dying. In the net, this was commented sharply as \"disco dance on the graves\". Many younger people reported in social media about their disgust before the Healing World Show. A small but growing crowd of young people, especially in the big cities, can no longer tolerate the gala, its embarrassing aesthetics, forced cheerfulness, the demonstrative display of love for the army and party, the gender stereotypes, the celebration of the traditional family. Not the slightest bit of negativity or criticism is allowed, love and happiness are obligatory: look at the grandiose overall picture of the nation and forget any pain. And the parents are always right and full of care, as are the party and its army.\nIn villages and small towns everything looks a little different. The younger migrant workers have an additional obligation during the spring holidays: they are sent to blind dates prepared by families and professional marriage mediators for them. They have to find a husband or wife in these ten days, because they usually do not have a holiday in the rest of the year. Blind dates arranged by the family are the norm for centuries\nin China. It was only with the founding of the People's Republic that this tradition slowly died out. In the country, however, marriage has resurrected as a prosperous industry in the last decade, in response to the bitter reality of migrant working life. In this respect, too, 2020 is an exceptional year: access to many small towns and villages is blocked in order to prevent infection with the Coronavirus. This is also the case with this year's marriage mediation.\nThe blind date industry is also thriving in the country because the ratio of female births to male births in China has a clear imbalance in favour of boys. China ranks 106 of 153 states in the current Global Gender Gap Index: the abortion of female fetuses or even the killing of female newborns is so widespread in some areas that young men hardly find partners anymore. Professional marriage became such a thing of necessity, only commercial institutes have the time to look for the few girls.\nMany reports describe the very direct selection procedures by which these dates are arranged. On a hectic day, a young woman can be reunited with more than a dozen men. It is then necessary to obtain information from applicants on cars, houses, income, body size, appearance, character, under the strict supervision of parents and other relatives. It sounds like a fun shopping experience: husband-jumping. However, given the low status of a wife in the village and the lack of institutional protection against domestic violence, marriage is a risky and burdensome matter for women. The smart girls marry a man with older sisters because they are usually obliged to support the younger brother financially in the country. Very brave young women refuse to marry, others go into town and work hard for their financial independence. But during the spring feast, even these rebellious women travel back to their parents and bring them money and gifts.\nFrom the third day of the new moon, people gradually return to their jobs. Once again the hectic efforts to get the bus, train or flight, but now in the state of food coma. Some are sad, most are rather relieved. After all, most of us have moved to the larger cities with good reason to study and work. Freedom and independence are seductive.\nI have read many old poems about the Spring Festival, about poets who had left their homelands. Most describe sadness and homesickness. Traditional Chinese have always seen leaving home as the greatest tragedy in life. China has obviously changed, despite all the apparent nostalgia for a glorious but stoned past. There will be more and more who identify with the modern spirit of the poet Meng Haoran from the Tang dynasty: \"I roam the world and have my pleasure wherever I am, I do not care about the old years that have passed\" (234583d; \"385433d;\"22788;\"19981d;\"352653d;\"24230d;)\nIn times of plague threat, even this pleasure is over. All that remains is a feeling of helplessness and anger towards a government that does not protect its citizens, but deliberately collapses.\nTranslation: Robert Meyer\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus-related risk low for U.S. life and health insurers.

Assets of U.S. life insurers were $7 trillion in 2018, down 2.7 percent from the year before.\n“How far the coronavirus outbreak will reach remains unknown, but life insurers are prepared to meet their commitments to policyholders,” council spokesman Whit Cornman said.\nThe HHS has partnered with a New York-based biotech company, Regeneron to develop a treatment.

Aside from the long duration of his quarantine, his actions were not exactly an unusual given the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic, But a Taiwanese paper has managed to unearth more details from Leehom about his decision. \n According to the report, Leehom held two concerts in Wuhan, China (where the outbreak is believed to have originated from) on December 29 and 30 last year, and had spent time shaking hands and taking pictures with fans backstage after each show. \n He recalled coming down with a 39°C fever on January 10, but he didn’t think too much about it and soldiered on with another concert in Kunming the next day despite feeling unwell and still nursing a 38.5°C fever. As the coronavirus was still a relatively new thing back then, nobody suspected it might have anything to do with his condition. \n After sweating it out on stage for over three hours, the fever gradually subsided, and Leehom started to recover on the 12th. However, with more and more COVID-19 cases popping up around the world, he chose to do the responsible thing and quarantine himself at home in Taiwan despite no longer displaying any symptoms himself. \n His decision led him to quit his role as a judge on the latest season of Chinese singing reality competition The Treasured Voice, 'cos hey, better safe than sorry, right? \n Leehom then fondly recalled the iconic 2003 song he and a few others wrote to encourage those battling SARS, called ‘Hand in Hand’. “To this day, that is still the most meaningful song in my entire career,” he mused. “It made me realise that music can truly be food for the soul.” \n While he may not have written any new tunes for COVID-19, Leehom has still done his part by reminding his followers to continue washing their hands and practise social distancing while going through this tough time together. \n “After this is all over, we will definitely meet again,” he promised. \n Photos: Wang Leehom/Instagram, Wang Leehom/Weibo\n"}, {"content": "China: Coronavirus death toll spikes to 425.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak could now be characterised as a \"pandemic\". The declaration came as the coronavirus cases are sharply increasing around the world.\nThe WHO also added that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them.\n\"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe WHO chief, however, maintained that the designation of the coronavirus as a pandemic did not mean the situation was hopeless. \"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\" he said.\nAddressing a news conference on Wednesday, the WHO chief urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role to curb it.\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe outbreak of coronavirus was declared as a pandemic as the United States stocks plunged into bear market territory and several American cities joined European counterparts in banning large gatherings due to the alarming levels of its spread.\nWHAT IS A PANDEMIC\nA pandemic is a worldwide spread of a disease or an infection. The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word 'epidemia' while the word pandemic originates from the word 'pandemos', which denotes \"all people\".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm\", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona.\n"}, {"content": "China delaying permission to India for sending plane to Wuhan: Official.

Competent departments of the two countries are keeping communication and coordination in this regard,\" she said.\nIndia's national carrier Air India has already evacuated around 640 Indians from Wuhan in two separate flights.\nAccording to estimates, over 100 Indians are still living in Wuhan. A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from the country in view of the massive outbreak of coronavirus there.\nIndian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait for the flight. The delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish, said the sources.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: China's death toll surges past 1,500 as Hubei province reports 139 new deaths. WUHAN (AFP, REUTERS) - More than 2,600 new cases were confirmed from a coronavirus outbreak in mainland China, health officials said on Saturday (Feb 15), a day after people returning to the capital from holidays were ordered to quarantine themselves for 14 days.  \n The total of confirmed infections across mainland China was now 66,492 after 2,641 new cases were confirmed, as of Friday, the National Health Commission said.  \n The death toll rose by 143 to 1,523, it said, with most of the new deaths in central Hubei province and in particular the provincial capital of Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the outbreak began in December.  \n National Health Commission official Liang Wannian told a news conference the government would continue to try to contain the spread of virus in Wuhan, which has been under virtual lockdown for three weeks.  The commission was focused on lowering the fatality rate and reducing the infection rate, Liang said.  \n The number of deaths in Hubei rose by 139 as of Friday, 107 of those in Wuhan. A total of 1,123 people in Wuhan have now died from the coronavirus. \n The Chinese capital Beijing on Friday imposed a 14-day self-quarantine on people returning to the city from holidays to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and threatened to punish those who failed to comply. \n It was not immediately clear how the restriction, relayed by the official Beijing Daily newspaper, would be enforced, or whether it would apply to non-residents of Beijing or foreigners arriving from abroad. \n China is struggling to get its economy going after the annual Chinese New Year holiday, which was extended for 10 days to help contain the outbreak of the new and highly contagious respiratory virus. \n A top Chinese official, in an interview with Reuters, acknowledged that coronavirus was a deep challenge, but defended Beijing’s management of the epidemic and lashed out at the “overreaction” of some other countries.  \n State Councillor Wang Yi, who also serves as China’s foreign minister, said China has taken the most rigorous and decisive measures to fight the epidemic, with many efforts going beyond international health regulations and World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations.  \n “Through our efforts the epidemic is overall under control,” he said. \n A WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.  \n The mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 healthworkers infected contracted the new virus, WHO officials said. \n The scale of the epidemic swelled this week after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to their tally.  Cases “clinically diagnosed” through lung imaging are now counted in addition to those that have shown up positive in laboratory tests.  \n The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei’s tally on Thursday, with the WHO noting that cases going back weeks were retroactively counted. \n Authorities said 1,716 medical workers have been infected during the outbreak, with six dying from the illness.  Most of the infections among health workers were in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, where many have lacked proper masks and gear to protect themselves in hospitals dealing with a deluge of patients. \n The grim figures come a week after grief and public anger erupted over the death of a whistleblowing doctor who had been reprimanded and silenced by police in Wuhan after raising the alarm about the virus in December. \n A number of trade fairs and industry conferences in China and overseas have been postponed due to transportation curbs and concerns about the spread of the virus.  \n International Business Machines (IBM) Corp said on Friday it had canceled its participation in the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco due to coronavirus-related concerns.  \n “The health of IBMers is our primary concern as we continue to monitor upcoming events and travel relative to Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)”, the company said in a tweet.  The event is scheduled to take place Feb 24–28.  \n Earlier in the day, Facebook Inc said it had cancelled its global marketing summit scheduled for next month, also in San Francisco, over concerns about coronavirus-related risks.  \n Th\ne Mobile World Congress (MWC), the annual telecoms industry gathering in Barcelona, was also canceled after a mass exodus by exhibitors linked to the coronavirus.\n"}, {"content": "Centre sets up task force to monitor coronavirus issue: MoS G Kishan Reddy.

(Sri Lankan presidency corrects victim's age to 65, paragraph 10)  \n By Nidhi Verma and Asif Shahzad  \n NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - India said on Saturday it was planning to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with coronavirus, as authorities scramble to prepare the country's health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the country's 1.3 billion people this week to stay indoors for three weeks in the world's biggest lockdown, seeking to curb the spread of the illness. India's network of trains, the country's lifeblood, has been idled.  \n One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday.  \n Once they get clearance, the plan is for each of India's railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Indian Railways has 16 zones, according to its website.  \n \"Railways will offer clean, sanitised & hygienic surroundings for the patients to comfortably recover,\" tweeted railways minister Piyush Goyal. He did not specify how many people could be cared for in each coach.  \n India has reported 918 confirmed cases, including 19 deaths.  \n The lockdown measures are taking a huge toll on India's poor, including millions of migrant labourers whose jobs in cities have vanished. Many are now walking back to their villages or crowded bus stations in the hopes of finding rare transport, raising fears they will unintentionally spread the virus across India.  \n On Saturday, a migrant worker, who set out from New Delhi on a 270 kilometres (168 miles) walk to his hometown in Madhya Pradesh, collapsed and died, a police official said.  \n India's home ministry said in a statement on Saturday it was advising states to provide food and shelter to migrants at relief camps alongside highways.  \n  \n PAKISTAN SEEKS ARRESTS  \n Overall, the number of coronavirus cases in South Asia has risen to 2,648, including 39 deaths. Sri Lanka reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, a 65-year-old diabetic tour guide.  \n While the toll in South Asia remains low overall, there are fears it could swell given the region's poor health services and population density.  \n In Pakistan, police on Saturday arrested 38 prayer leaders and mosque officials for violating a ban on congregational prayers even as cases swelled to over 1,400 in the country.  \n A plane carrying relief assistance and eight doctors from key ally China landed in Islamabad on Saturday, a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said.  \n \"(They will) advise our health care specialists in the light of their experience and success in battling COVID-19 in China,\" the statement read. China has already given Islamabad testing kits, masks, protective gear and other medical equipment.  \n In Nepal, more than 600 European tourists were evacuated on charter flights on Saturday, authorities said, but thousands more are still waiting to be brought home by their countries.  \n \"This will leave between 8,000 and 10,000 tourists still stranded due to lockdown in Nepal,\" said Dhananjay Regmi, the chief of Nepal's tourism board.

SHANGHAI — The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat — setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game — 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS ‘SPILLOVER’ \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy — like the civet or some rats or bats — or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.

The new coronavirus that causes pneumonias and originates in China has already killed 131 people in China and infected more than five.500 people worldwide, including a nine-month baby, but what is unknown about the virus is even more than what is already known.\nThe exact origin of the virus is still unknown, which host (animal) and whether or not there was an intermediate host. It is also not yet clear the form of transmission between humans, the exact period in which this transmission takes place and the rate of attack of the virus. That is, know the epidemiology of the new infection -Who, How and When?\nHere are some questions about the virus for which there is no answer:\nWhat is the true rate of attack? Although the number of infected is increasing daily, it is still not really known what the range of the virus is.\nWho are the most affected people?\nIt is not known whether the virus also affects all types of people, from adults or children, sick or healthy, as pointed out to the agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe Froes, appointed representative of the Medical Association for issues related to the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nThe international authorities do not yet know who has the most serious forms of the disease and what the characteristics of those killed by this new virus are.\nPneuologist Filipe Froes recalls that no serious situation has yet occurred outside China, although all cases of the disease are imported.\nDoes the virus affect children? And what's your expression in paediatric age?\nThere is a case report of a nine-month-old baby infected by one parent, but it is not yet known whether the virus has affected children in the same way as it affects adults.\nWhat's the transmission period?\nPneuologist Filipe Froes recalls that the Chinese authorities warned that there may be transmission between people even before the onset of symptoms. It is not known whether it is an exception or a rule and how long before symptoms show up can the disease be contagious. It is also unknown whether, as in the case of SARS (English acronym for Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome), there are patients with a higher contagious capacity than others.\nIt is also unknown what the longest period of transmission and even when it occurs.\nWhat treatments are there?\nPatients are currently being treated with supportive measures that only treat the symptoms of the disease, such as fever or respiratory distress. There is still no specific medicine for this new coronavirus.\nFilipe Froes indicates that there will be experimental treatments under way, but it is still unknown how effective they will be.\nAccording to the expert, a vaccine will already be in development, based largely on the work that had been done for atypical pneumonia of 2002/2003-SARS. It is also necessary to wait for tests on effectiveness and safety.\nWhat is the exact origin of the virus?\nThe first cases of the new human coronavirus were linked to a fish and meat market in the Chinese town of Wuhan. However, it is not known which animal transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor whether an animal is the original host and another intermediate host.\nSo what is known about the new coronavirus?\nCoronavirus is a large family of viruses living in other animals (e.g. birds, bats, small mammals) and which in humans usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common cold to more serious cases such a s pneumonias. They can be transmitted between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. In fact, so far, only six strains of coronavirus among the thousands existing have crossed the species barrier and reached people.\nThe new coronavirus is from the same family as the Grave Acute Respiratory Syndrome (2002-2003) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (2012).\nThese two types of coronavirus are so far those who have been able to cross the species barrier and to transmit themselves to humans and who have pictures of some gravity, explained to Lusa Agency pneumologist Filipe Froes.\nThe first cases of 2019-nCoV appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan's seafood and meat market in the same city. Ain\nthe exact origin of the infection is unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, to transmit it to humans.\nThese viruses are usually transmitted via the airway and mainly affect the respiratory tract, especially the lungs in severe forms.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses are more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress. In the initially confirmed cases, 90% showed fever, 80% dry cough, 20% shortness of breath and only about 15% presented difficulty.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Pompeo says China still withholding coronavirus information.

China's economic fundamentals remain robust and consumer spending and production have only been delayed, he said.  \n \"Hopefully across the nation we'll see a strong rebound in the not-too-distant future,\" he said.  \n The comments come as the number of new daily infections from the COVID-19 virus is increasing outside of China faster than inside, and that follows crippling Chinese restrictions imposed to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.  \n Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.  \n \"After several weeks of fighting against this disease, the message is that COVID-19 is a virus that can be contained,\" Peiwu said. \"It's a common challenge.

Peiwu praised the country for not over-reacting and being \"clear-headed and evidence based\", while Beijing has accused the United States of scaremongering for its quick evacuations and travel restrictions.  \n However, Canada's measured reaction has not paved the way for a resolution to the long-running dispute between the two nations, which started in December 2018 when Canadian police arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, on a U.S. arrest warrant.  \n Shortly afterward, Beijing detained two Canadian men who were later charged for spying and are still being held.  \n \"Of course, there's still an outstanding issue between the two countries,\" Peiwu said.  \n The first phase of the legal battle over whether Meng should be extradited to the United States wrapped up in January. China has repeatedly demanded that Ottawa release her, but the Canadian government says it will not interfere in the judicial process.  \n \"It's our consistent hope that the Canadian side will make the right decision,\" the ambassador said.

MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - A pneumonia outbreak in central China widened with more than 200 people now diagnosed with the new Sars-like virus, as health experts said there is now evidence that the illness is spreading from people to people. \n With increased searching and testing for the novel virus among people with symptoms like fever and coughing, the number of cases in China surged over the weekend. Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, now has almost 200 confirmed cases, with three fatalities. Cases were also reported in Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. \n Across the region, South Korea detected its first case, according to news agency Yonhap, adding to those found in Thailand and Japan last week. \n The surge in cases, after the World Health Organisation (WHO) released guidance for diagnostic detection of the virus on Friday (Jan 17), confirmed suspicions that the illness is being spread from people to people. There are no reports yet of health-care workers being infected, a sign that the virus is likely not as infectious as Sars, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. \n \"It is clear that there is at least some human-to-human transmission from the evidence we have, but we don't have clear evidence that shows the virus has acquired the capacity to transmit among humans easily,\" said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO's regional director for the western pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. \n \"We need more information to analyse that.\" \n Countries across the world stepped up screening among arriving passengers ahead of the Chinese New Year festival that starts this Friday, a period of heightened travel for Chinese people. International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco started screening from late Friday, joining cities in Asia that implemented the surveillance measure days after the outbreak was reported on Dec 31. \n In Wuhan, health-care workers spread out across the city of 11 million, screening for symptoms among people on planes and at railway stations. \n \"This is a situation where we're going to see additional cases all around the world as folks look for it more,\" Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the US's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday. \n \"It's highly plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States, and that's the reason that we're moving forward so quickly with this screening.\" \n It's possible that more than 1,700 people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, Prof Neil Ferguson and colleagues at Imperial College London said in a study on Friday. Their analysis was based on cases reported outside China last week, with the assumption that it takes five or six days for someone to feel unwell after being infected, and another four or five days for the infection to be detected. \n The widening of cases sparked a rally in Chinese drugmakers' shares on Monday. Antibiotic makers Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co, Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co and Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering Co all rose by the 10 per cent daily limit in early trading. \n Shares of companies in the travel and hotel sectors dropped on fears of a hit to tourism over the Lunar New Year, traditionally a peak period of spending for China's billion-strong consumer force.

While rare, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people, and then spread between people. \n The source and transmission routes of the 2019-nCov virus are still unknown, China's National Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. \n Some of the first group of patients in Wuhan worked or shopped at a seafood market where live animals and wildlife parts were also reportedly sold. \n The closed Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the Wuhan virus cluster.

The patients, who have a history of travel to Wuhan, have been hospitalised and are in stable condition. \n Officials in Thailand reported two cases last week, while Japan confirmed a case on Thursday.

SHANGHAI - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country's fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier \"second wave\" could hit later in the year.  \n As the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.  \n But medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country's strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.  \n Though they remain wary of the risks of \"importing\" cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.  \n \"For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn't be a great concern,\" said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.  \n She told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.  \n The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it \"could be over by June\" if other countries take the required action.  \n On Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease's epicentre of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, \"imported\" infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.  \n Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China's actions to contain the virus have been \"extraordinary\" but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.  \n \"(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,\" he said.  \n  \n DONE \"99 OUT OF 100\"  \n Gao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed \"99 out of 100 steps\" required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiralled out of control, \"the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.\"  \n Some experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognise the current virus was different from influenza.  \n Global inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.  \n \"The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behaviour of this virus we are still very much in the dark,\" Henderson said. \"The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.\"  \n Some experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.  \n Preliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks \"much like other respiratory diseases\".  \n However, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.  \n However, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer an\nd wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, \"it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\"  \n Gao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.  \n \"The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.\" REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Cargill bans international travel for staff amid coronavirus outbreak.

Although it may feel like ages, we are still in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak caused by a new coronavirus.   \n As two old hands who experienced the struggles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in Singapore, we are gratified to see that preparedness systems are in place here and working well.  \n The measures introduced have even been endorsed by infectious disease experts such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Professor David Heymann, who noted that despite causing inconveniences, Singapore “is not overdoing it”.  \n Nonetheless, a crisis of public confidence is moving faster than the crisis of public health.  \n Masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants were the first to fly off the shelves. Even in our traditionally stoic society, a breach in our psychological defence occurred when some took to hoarding food and household items once Singapore moved to Dorscon Orange on Feb 7.   \n Can we succeed in beating this virus? The answer is most certainly yes, and we are confident of the reasons why.  \n UNDERSTANDING OUR INSECURITY  \n Insecurity amidst uncertainty is to be expected. Many reports, some untrue, are making their rounds in chat groups, stoking public anxiety, doubt and fear. \n We are sad to see Sars revisited in many ways, with the old unfounded fears of infection prompting members of the public to shun healthcare workers and landlords to throw out tenants who had travelled to China.  \n But Covid-19 is much less deadly than Sars or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). Case-fatality rate measures the number of deaths among those infected and this is now coming out consistently to be much lower for Covid-19.   \n On the other hand, this disease is far more capable of transmitting between humans than Sars or Mers. Transmissibility is measured by its reproduction number — cases directly generated from each case — and this is showing to be more like pandemic influenza. \n While social media can be useful, it also means that information can be overstated. Bad news spreads faster than good news. Media, which build in algorithms that prioritise sites similar to those often visited, compound biases in line with previous viewpoints and worsen fear. \n The authorities have been quick to provide timely updates and dispel rumours.   \n But people have different ways to judge the impact for themselves, with some even contemplating the “what-ifs” future state, such as Dorscon Red. Hence, expectations and beliefs honed from prior experience and observation of other countries contribute towards behaviours such as panic buying. \n The verdict on this outbreak is not out yet. Much attention is on the effectiveness of control measures in China. \n Some assess that disease incidence will decline into the warmer months of summer. Others believe Covid-19 will last longer, and possibly become endemic in a way similar to influenza.   \n Whichever the case may be, we can prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.  \n Co-author Leo Yee Sin (right) briefing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his visit to NCID on Jan 31, 2020.   Photo: Raj Nadarajan / TODAY \n WHY WE ARE CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS  \n Whether the outbreak lasts weeks or months, halting this outbreak in its tracks ultimately depends not so much on disease duration as on our collective resilience.  \n Sustainability is key to preparing for a long battle. Support for each other is crucial to our psychological defence.  \n When we recall events of 2003, the immediate impact of Sars was fear. But out of this grew one long-lasting positive effect, in the form of a nationwide crash course on the importance of good hygiene practices.   \n Being a compact city state with a high population density, and dependent on global connectivity for our life blood, we have to accept many hard truths.  \n But we are not helpless. There are many actions we can take together to safeguard public health and minimise the impact of acute events that endanger us.   \n Unwelcome as they are, public health emergencies will occur from time to time and they represent opportunities for us to derive valuable information not just about the disease threat, but also about ourselves.   \n Courageous volunteers are offering their skills and support in the community. Scientists are readily sharing knowledge to address the dearth of understanding on how Covid-19 originates an\nd spreads. \n And we have dedicated healthcare and public health professionals, many with experience from Sars.  \n In addition, Singapore's unique size also works in our favour. Many challenges are much more manageable in scale here than they would be in other countries.  \n We have ample resources, invested heavily during peacetime. We also have the will to learn from our mistakes and stand together. \n These assets collectively constitute our urban health security. Hence, we are confident of success. \n COMMUNITY-BASED RESPONSE VITAL  \n New cases are being reported at an alarming rate in many places outside China. As global events unfold, the momentum of this disease is such that we can expect the outbreak (and case-fatality) to get worse before it gets better. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. \n Just as with Sars, here is a chance for us to improve our community-based response with social norms of self-reliance, solidarity and cooperation. \n With concerns over rapid local spread, we must wash our hands regularly and if we feel unwell, wear a mask and avoid contact with others. We must also be judicious in the use of limited resources.   \n Inconvenience is inevitable, but we must be patient. The virus does not discriminate, and neither must we.  \n While we stay geared to fight, our spirits are uplifted by human stories of selflessness. We sense a groundswell of people motivated to strengthen our urban health security. \n Indeed, some of the panic buying ostensibly for one’s own and relatives could be arising from pent-up emotions seeking ways to respond. Perhaps we can harness this for a greater good.  \n Acts of kindness — people cooperating to give unused masks and hand sanitisers to others, and to cheer on frontline workers with food and messages of love and care — nourish our hearts with a warm glow of togetherness. \n The National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health have linked up with various groups to address requests on how to mount community-based responses, and clarify any misinformation on the outbreak. \n As the national crisis unfolds on two fronts — public health and public confidence — we see an excellent learning moment for all of us.  \n The community is proving vital to Team Singapore. Hence, connection and engagement with them in one whole-of-society approach should not be ignored. \n Once Singapore ceases its containment efforts and life gets back to a semblance of normality, we may yet be surprised that it happened sooner than we expected. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Associate Professor Ooi Peng Lim is senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and teaches field epidemiology at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan\nhave formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. In fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to India.\nMy family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away.\nOur government is trying its best to bring us back.\nWe were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from India.\nNow we are waiting for that official phone call from the Indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.\n"}, {"content": "Minister confirms first positive case of coronavirus in Portugal.

The ship, which on Wednesday moved away from shore for cleaning, will once again be docked at Yokohoma harbor in southern Tokyo for supplies, while the infected will be taken to medical centers in the region.\nChina has today elevated to 563 dead and over 28 thousand infected the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (center), placed under quarantine. In the last 24-hour period, there have been seven deaths and three.694 new cases.\nThe first person to die from the new coronavirus outside China was a Chinese citizen in the Philippines. In addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are other confirmed cases of infection in more than twenty countries, the last new case identified in Belgium on Tuesday.

The Surat diamond industry is likely to face a loss of around Rs 8,000 crores in next two months as Hong Kong, which is a major export destination, has declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, say experts.\n\nHong Kong is a major business hub for the Surat diamond industry, but schools and colleges have been closed there till the first week of March and even businesses are seeing a dip in view of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.\nAccording to Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) regional chairman Dinesh Navadiya, polished diamonds worth around Rs 50,000 crore are exported from Surat to Hong Kong every year.\n\"That's around 37 per cent of the total exports from here. Now, due to the coronavirus scare, Hong Kong has declared a month-long vacation. Gujarati traders having offices there are coming back to India,\" he said.\nIf the situation does not improve, it will have a huge impact on the Surat diamond industry, which polishes 99 per cent of all rough diamonds imported in the country, he said.\n\"The Surat diamond industry is staring at a loss of around Rs 8,000 crore for February and March,\" he added.\nAnother industry expert and diamond merchant Pravin Nanavati said there was a possibility of cancellation of an international jewellery exhibition in Hong Kong, to be held next month, due to the coronavirus scare, which would hit also the jewellery business in Surat.\n\"Polished diamonds and jewellery made in Surat reach across the world through Hong Kong only. Now, due to vacations there, our business is totally closed. Traders are also returning to India,\" he said.\nIf the situation does not improve, the Surat diamond trade losses may run into \"several thousand crores\", he said.\n\"We have been informed that the international exhibition in Hong Kong may be put off due to the coronavirus scare.

The outbreak of a new 'mysterious' virus named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has raised alarm bells among health officials the world over as number of people infected and the resultant death toll continues to rise.\nAs on January 21, six people have died and close to 291 infected by 2019-nCoV, a new strain of coronaviruses that is reported to have infected humans for the first time.\nThough health officials are still tracing the exact source of this outbreak, initial investigations have indicated it started at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Most of the infected patients in Wuhan had either worked or visited this market. It has been shut since January 1.\nOutside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand, one each in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea among people returning from Wuhan. The Philippines too identified its first suspected case of 2019-novel coronavirus on January 21.\nFaced with this new health emergency, scientists in China and elsewhere are brainstorming to find effective measures to identify the virus' source and contain its impact.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has convened a meeting of its Emergency Committee on Wednesday to decide whether the outbreak should be declared an international health emergency.\nUsually, these declarations are made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require an internationally coordinated response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, the Associated Press reported.\nSeveral Asian countries, including India, have issued health advisories, and many have started screening passengers arriving from China at their airports. On January 17, three major airports in the US-Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco-started screening people arriving from Wuhan.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) too has said the infection may spread to other places, and has issued interim guidelines based on the limited information available about 2019-novel coronavirus. It has however not called for any trade or travel restrictions so far.\nWHAT IS 2019-NOVEL CORONAVIRUS?\nThe 2019-nCoV is a new strain of cornoviruses and has not been previously seen in humans. Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV).\nThese aren't the only form of coronaviruses. There are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans.\nThe WHO had earlier said there was no clear evidence of any human-to-human transmission of this virus, but on January 20, Chinese health officials confirmed they have identified some cases of human-to-human transmission.\nWHAT CAN 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death.\nThe WHO has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-nCoV:\nTo contain the viral infection, health officials in China have isolated the infected patients who are being treated at various medical institutions in Wuhan.\nWHERE DID THE OUTBREAK START?\nOn December 8, 2019, a patient in Wuhan city reportedly complained of pneumonia-like symptoms and sought medical help at a local hospital. Within days, many others reported similar problems, prompting health officials to launch an investigation.\nOn December 31, China informed the WHO's country office about these pneumonia cases emanating from \"unknown causes\" in Wuhan.\nTaking note of the matter and the limited information available, the WHO issued interim guidelines for all countries.\nOn January 7, Chinese authorities said they have identified 2019-nCoV as the cause of the pneumonia.\nHowever, experts are yet to identify the source of 2019-nCoV i.e. the animal from which it transmitted to humans.\nSix days later, on January 12, in a statement the WHO said national health officials in China have reported 41 confirmed cases related to this new type of pneumonia. Of these 41 patients, seven were severely ill.\nBy January 21, the number of cases rose to 217, with 198 in Wuhan alone.\nThese apart, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one each in Japan and South Korea.\nCASES OUTSIDE CHINA\nTwo confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand, besides one each in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea so far. All of these patients had recently returned from Wuhan and are being treated. The Philippines too has identified one suspected case of novel coronavirus.\nThe patient in Japan, a man, had travelled to Wuhan in late December and developed fever on January 3 when he was still in Wuhan. WHO says as per information received from Japan, the man didn't visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (to which most cases have been linked) or any other live animal market in Wuhan. He has also denied having close contact with any person suffering from pneumonia.\nHe returned to Japan on January 6 and tested negative for influenza. When his condition didn't improve, he visited a local hospital on January 10 and a chest x-ray revealed abnormal infiltrates. Following this, he was admitted and on January 14, the doctor attending him notified his case to a local public health authority as an unidentified serious infectious illness'.\nWhen his samples were collected and tested by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, very small amount of 2019-nCoV RNA were identified.\nIn Thailand, the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV infection was identified on January 13 (a 61-year-old woman) and the second case on January 17 (a 74-year-old woman). They had both returned from China.\nAs a precautionary measure, Thai authorities have started screening passengers at airports and thousands of passengers have been screened since January 3.\nPRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nWuhan is a major city in China which is also a hub of international and domestic travels. Much remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection transmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions.\nMANY MORE AFFECTED THAN OFFICIAL FIGURES, CLAIMS STUDY\nAs on January 21, there were around 220 confirmed cases of infections arising from 2019-novel coronavirus.\nHowever, diseases monitoring experts in the UK have challenged this number and presented a study claiming that the actual number of patients infected can be much more than the official figures.\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" the study said.\nSpeaking to BBC, Prof Neil Frugson, who was part of the study, said he was worried by the fact that three cases had been reported outside China (all comprising people who had been to Wuhan). \"For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,\" Prof Frugson told the BBC.\nTHREAT FROM YEARLY MIGRATION \nWith the ongoing festivities of the Chinese New Year, there is a heightened risk of 2019-nCoV infection spreading to other regions because in the coming weeks people (especially non-natives of Wuhan) will be travelling home for vacations.\nChina's Transport Ministry has estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made during the festivities which trigger the world biggest annual human migration.\nOfficials have said extra precautions will be taken this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.\n\"Transport hubs will strengthen disinfection, monitoring and prevention measures, Wang Yang,\" the Chinese Ministry of Transport's chief engineer, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. \"The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" Wang said.\nThe WHO too has said that the annual human migration for these festivities can increase the risk of 2019-nCoV cases being reported from elsewhere.\nWith inputs from The Associated Press and Reuters.\n(This article has been updated with latest figures as on January 21.)\n"}, {"content": "wuhan virus: a timeline of how deadly virus spread.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI - India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol, a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen, as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.  \n The Indian government urged calm and said there were enough stocks to manufacture formulations for two-to-three months.  \n The government's list of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and medicines accounts for 10% of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and includes several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12.  \n It was unclear how the restriction would impact the availability of these medicines in the countries that import from India and also depend on China. In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on.  \n \"Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby 'restricted' with immediate effect and till further orders,\" the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.  \n \"Irrespective of the ban, some of these molecules may face shortages for the next couple of months,\" Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n \"If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages,\" Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected \"high viral load\" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India's National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n \"There is no need to panic,\" he said in a tweet.  \n \"Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

Novel coronavirus has tested the might of the world powers. The world is feeling the heat of the pandemic on multiple fronts. It is scampering to rescue humankind from grip of Covid-19 and facing an uphill task of preventing an economic collapse.\nWhile concrete data of loss in businesses and of employment come months later, the sentiment in the markets across the world is gloomy. This is reflected in the frequent crashes in the share markets in all parts of the world.\nThis is the biggest economic crisis in the world since 2008. Some people are already calling it the biggest since 1929-30 economic recession. Unemployment has risen in all affected countries. In the US, data point to biggest jump in people enrolling for unemployment benefits. In India, the worries are similar but there are no concrete data yet to support.\nThe only data reflection is share market. The Sensex is racing to go back to the pre-Modi government level in India. On Monday, the Sensex closed below 26,000-mark. It recorded the biggest-ever single-day fall of 3,934 points closing at 25,981. The Sensex had crossed the 25,000-mark barrier for the first time on the day the Modi government was voted to power in 2014 - on the day of counting.\nIn the past one month, the Sensex has broken record of biggest single-day fall five times. The current season of coronavirus-induced volatility in the share market has wiped off Rs 52 lakh crore of the investors. This is a picture in contrast from the high point on January 13 this year when the Sensex was racing towards 42,000-mark having crossed 41,952.\nThe template is same for all the major economies. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has enforced four circuit breakers in the Month of March. It is a safeguard that pauses trading for 15 minutes hoping the market will calm.\nCircuit breaker is a tool created in the US after 1987 market crash in which the Dow plunged nearly 23 per cent. Before being enforced four times this month, it had been used only once - during 1997 crash.\nSimilar panic has been seen in the UK, Germany, France and all Asian markets except China, the source country for novel coronavirus pandemic.\nChina's share market benchmark, Shanghai Composite Index (SCE) was at 2,915 on December 12. It was just before the news of novel coronavirus outbreak in China started surfacing. It reached the high point of 3,115 on January 13 and slipped marginally to 3,095 on January 20 when China for the first time officially admitted novel coronavirus outbreak with pressure building from within and outside the country.\nOn January 23, when it closed for Chinese new year holidays, it was trading at 2,976. It saw a major fall on February 3 when it opened after holidays were extended in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak. Trading was closed before time at 2,746 point.\nInterestingly, China a day earlier had announced infusing liquidity worth of $173 billion into its markets. This kept the sentiments in Chinese markets in good spirit despite increasing cases of novel coronavirus in China through February. The result was the losses in Chinese stock markets were not as severe as outside.\nThe Shanghai Composite on Tuesday stood at 2,722 - not much below the pre-Covid-19 phase. The world has lost hundreds of billions during this phase.\nWhile Indian rupee has been fragile under the impact of novel coronavirus, Chinese yuan or renminbi has remained relatively strong against the US dollar. In the official basket of currencies, yuan has, in fact, climbed more than 4.75 per cent this year, which has been under the shadow of coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the average daily difference in the US and Chinese 10-year government bond yield is 172 basis points. This means the Chinese assets offers far more attractive returns for an investor.\nSimply put, China seems to be the financially least affected of all countries rocked by novel coronavirus pandemic despite weeks of lockdown. Share market data may not be the ultimate measure of economic impact of Covid-19. However, China is not known to put out adverse data in public. So, true scale of damage may not be known for years.\nThere is another explanation, however, for less volatility seen in China's share markets. Of the tradable share market capitalization in China, foreign capital accounts for less than four per cent. The rest is in the hands of the\nChinese government, directly or indirectly.\nThe curve of Chinese stock exchange indices is also curious in the sense that China's was one of the worst-performing share markets before Covid-19 changed the world market outlook.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Marriott, Booking Holdings warn of virus hit as JetBlue waives cancellation fees.

With the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) suspending the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 till 15th April 2020, as a precautionary measure against the ongoing novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the decision marks only the 3rd time when the popular tournament has been effected due to external events.\nIPL 2020 was originally slated to start from March 29 and continue till May 24 but the fate of the tournament now lies in the dark as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rise within the country.\nThe deadly virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,900 lives and infected more than 124,330 people worldwide. India on Thursday reported its first novel Covid-19 fatality after a 76-year-old man who died two days ago was tested positive. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country soared to 75 on Friday.\nAs we continue to track the developments surrounding the IPL 2020 and the coronavirus outbreak, here is a look at the past instances when the tournament has had to undergo changes in the schedule/venue owing to factors not in the BCCI's control:\n2009\nThe 2nd edition of IPL was entirely played in South Africa because of the Lok Sabha general elections which were also going to clash with the marquee event. With 2 mega events planned in the same window, the unavailability of security forces in the country forced the BCCI to shift the entire tournament out of India and in to South Africa. Still, the tournament proved to be a huge success after you discount the bizarre seven-and-a-half-minute television timeout which was introduced in the IPL for the first time. The now-defunct franchise Deccan Chargers won their maiden IPL title under the leadership of Adam Gilchrist beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 6 runs in a pulsating final.\n2014\nThe general elections once again proved to be the IPL's bane as a part of the tournament was held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Held from April 16, 2014 to June 1, 2014, the 1st 20 matches of the 7th season of the IPL were held different stadiums in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah with the tournament returning to India on May 2.\nAs it was 5 years ago, this time too, the main reason for the venue shift was the clash with the general elections in the country. In the final played in Bangalore, Kolkata Knight Riders won the trophy by chasing down Kings XI Punjab's target of 200 with relative ease. India Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who scored a thrilling 115* off 55 balls in the title-clash, also became the 1st player to score a century in an IPL final.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Chinese exports drop 15.9% in the first two months of the year.

When will the outbreak peak?\nNo one knows for sure. It's difficult to estimate the evolution of the new coronavirus. This Wednesday, the World Health Organisation announced that a group of experts in China had concluded that the peak of the epidemic had already occurred between January 23 and February 2nd, considering that the increase in cases has stabilised since then. But there are other scientists in China and Europe who estimate that the peak of the epidemic will only occur at the end of February (that is, during this week). Other researchers believe that the new coronavirus will still infect millions of people over the coming period. The cases increase every day, showing that the virus continues to add victims at the site of origin of the outbreak (in China) and outside Asia. Although it is not yet possible to pinpoint exactly the peak of the epidemic, it is safe to say that the cases have not yet shown any signs of a marked slowdown. In recent days, Italy has become an important focus of infection in Europe.\nIs the mortality rate still low?\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nYes,ma'am. Overall, the mortality rate is currently in the 2,1%, still far from other coronaviruses such as SARS or MERS, with 9,5% and 34,5% respectively. However, it is impossible to say whether this is the ultimate mortality rate associated with this virus. As the situation develops, the data may change. A detailed analysis of the information on all confirmed cases to date on the Worldometer website reveals for example that the mortality rate in Wuhan (where the new coronavirus was identified in December) is 4,9%. In the analysis of more than 2500 deaths recorded so far worldwide and corresponding to a 2,1% mortality rate, there are more men (two thirds of cases), over 80% of the victims were over 60 years old and 75% had other related diseases.\nHow many infected people did you recover?\nMost of the victims recovered. At this moment, in a total of cases approaching the 80 thousand there is the record of more than 25 thousand people who will have fully recovered from the infection after a positive diagnosis. Of the more than 51 thousand cases still under medical surveillance in several countries, 78% show mild symptoms and 22% are considered worrying or critical cases.\n"}, {"content": "The Dark Corona. On January 31, as a special Air India flight evacuated 324 Indians from Wuhan, Monika Sethuraman, 31, broke down in tears realising that she wouldn't be on the plane. \"I couldn't breathe for a few seconds...I am stuck here in the city, and it's now turned into a huge prison,\" she says over the phone from her one-room dormitory. The doctoral scholar in international relations at Wuhan's Central China Normal University had been instrumental in contacting the Indian embassy and arranging the evacuation of fellow Indians following an outbreak of the new novel corona­virus (2019-nCoV).\nFor Sethuraman herself, leaving Wuhan won't be easy now. \"I didn't go to the airport because I knew I would not be cleared for the flight out. Even if I recover from the cold, once you are on the blacklist, you will not be allowed to fly out,\" she laments. Since the transport lockdown on January 23, Sethuraman has stocked up on essentials. According to her, stepping out is futile. One will be spotted by a drone, the building security cameras or police, and sent back indoors. \"The authorities aren't interested in testing or verifying if you have the virus. They are only interested in control...it doesn't matter if we live or die so as long as the virus is contained,\" she says. \"I am foll­owing WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, but there is no human interface to connect to. If people see you wiping your nose, they run from you, including the officials. That's the kind of panic and desperation here.\"\nThe travails of Vinay Ahuja, 38, who was visiting business associates in the region when the city went into a lockdown, are no different. \"Nobody expected it to escalate so quickly,\" he says, as he marks time before he gets permission to fly out. What Ahuja and many others are wondering is whether India would be able to replicate China's iron-fisted attempts to control the outbreak in a similar situation. China has been criticised by human rights groups, but received praise from WHO for its aggressive approach to control 2019-nCoV. The country built a 645,000 sq. ft emergency hospital in Wuhan in just 10 days. The two-storeyed hospital has 30 intensive care units (ICUs), 1,000 beds and special corridors to limit patient-nurse contact. A second hospital could be up by February 5.\nSeldom has an illness-largely a little-known respiratory disease-aroused such apprehensions as the 'corona', now part of the popular lexicon as a dreaded threat, eclipsing the pleasant connotations of being the aura around the Sun and a branded cold brew. First detected in December 2019, 2019-nCoV is a previously unidentified strain. It comes from the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), which claimed 774 lives, including three Indians in 2002-03.\nThe situation in India is nowhere as grim as at epicentre Wuhan, though three cases had been confirmed until February 5, while 3,935 were under observation at isolation wards across the country, apart from the special camps for Wuhan returnees near Delhi airport. So, how prepared is India to handle the coronavirus in case the numbers spike?\nConsidering there is no vaccine or trial-proven drug therapy yet, aff­ected patients are being treated symptomatically based on clinical severity. \"Serious cases who have viral pneumonia will need supportive intensive care, including mechanical ventilation when required. Hospitals in large cities can provide this, if the numbers are not overwhelming. Small towns and rural areas in most states will be ill-equipped if the virus spreads further,\" says Dr K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).\nThe public health system will have to go the extra mile to check the potential spread of the virus. Entry points to the country are being closely monitored to assess incoming travellers. There is still the danger of infected persons slipping through in the asymptomatic but infectious phase of the illness. Isolation of clinically-suspected cases is essential even where a specific virological diagnosis is not immediately available. Close contacts of affected persons are being advised clinical assessment and restricted mobility till the incubation period (up to two weeks) is over. \"Since the symptoms are not specific to this virus, a high index of suspicion is needed based on history of exposure to a proven/ likely case, even where laboratory facilities for a specific viral diagnosis are not readily available,\" exp\nlains Reddy. \"We have to educate the public with well-framed risk communication messaging and health advice, and all healthcare providers must follow the correct diagnostic/ clinical protocols.\"\nA comprehensive nationwide surveillance system is still a work in progress. While this network has expanded since the H1N1 virus threat loomed large a decade ago, competent labs are needed at more locations. In 2012, there was a proposal to set up 150 diagnostic and research labs with virology-related expertise. Of these, 80 are operable now, but this number is far from adequate. These are also not linked to the public health response system and only serve as support for ad hoc reporting.\nThough India has an integrated dis­ease surveillance programme in each district, this is done at a micro level and largely follows a symptomatic approach. \"We need case-based surveillance-where any suspicious disease outbreaks are reported to labs for real-time con­f­irmation. What we have is reporting at district levels based on extreme symptoms,\" says Dr G. Arun Kumar, head, Manipal Institute of Virology, one of four diagnostic labs under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\nDetailed investigations found that the SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans in China in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The animal source of the 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified. It's likely the source is a live animal market in China.\nLabs and the health system have also largely overlooked animal research and the risk mapping of India. There are several types of animal to human transmitted (zoonotic) diseases. They vary in terms of pathogen diversity (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths) and animal sources (bats, pigs, chickens, other birds, palm civets, dogs, fishes, crustaceans and snakes). India has fairly well-established programmes for monitoring zoonotic diseases like rabies, brucellosis and Japanese encephalitis. It is the threat of newer viruses, transmitted from wild or cap­tive bred animals, that is most worrisome.\n\"To identify the emergence and spread patterns of zoonotic pathogens, we need a 'one-health' approach, combining research data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations involving biology, epidemiology and clinical studies. Surveillance of wet markets, involving sale of animal foods, has to be strengthened. At the same time, research needs to identify entry points of zoonotic pathogens from outbreaks in other countries,\" explains Dr Reddy.\nAgencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the ICMR have advanced efforts in these areas. Yet, India is unequal to the task, be it handling an emergency or pursuing priority research. The weak links lie in inadequately integ­rated epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in forests, close-bred veterinary clusters and human population groups. This is one of the reasons why Nipah claimed 17 lives in Kerala in 2018. The dearth of virologic and taxonomic studies on native bats made it difficult to understand the nature of the virus. However, the state has learnt from the tragedy. Kerala has declared 2019-nCoV a state calamity and has kept over 2,000 people under surveillance at their homes. \"This is to tighten vigil rather than create panic. We do not want to miss out on any case,\" says state health minister K.K. Shailaja.\nThis level of vigilance has not been replicated elsewhere. Despite India being in the top 30 countries at risk from the virus, there has been no statement from the minister of health and no central guidelines for detecting and controlling infection. In contrast, European countries began tracking down visitors from China and putting out strong public advisories two weeks after the outbreak. Precautionary guidelines for the public in India are yet to be widely disseminated, in English or in local languages.\n\"There are all kinds of misleading reports giving the public incorrect information to help cure the virus. Most people also do not know how to protect themselves, which masks to wear, and so on. Public education has been entirely neglected so far,\" says Chapal Mehra, a public health specialist in Delhi. \"We need a proactive approach, not a reactionary one. Large-scale screening of risk individuals has to be a priority. It's a challenge for our public health system, which is yet to come out with a strategic approach to the issue,\" he adds.\nA\nconcerted multi-agency response, led by a competent public health system, is the need of the hour, but it is currently hampered by the limited expertise in the country. In the medium term, agile outbreak response systems have to be built, primary healthcare facilities (where clinical assessments take place) strengthened and vaccine development efforts advanced.\nIf the virus does spread here in the same magnitude as in Wuhan, the impact on the economy, healthcare and public morale could be catastrophic. With one of the world's highest population densities, especially in urban cities like Delhi and Mumbai, maintaining three-feet distance between individuals (as recommended by the WHO) will be impossible, nor will the lockdown of an entire city be feasible. Meanwhile, social media broadcasts by individuals in Wuhan paint a grim picture. Shortage of food and medicines, panic and misinformation, depression, even theft-the virus doesn't just destroy health, it destroys society. It's already visible in Kerala. There are media reports of families of China returnees being 'ostracised'.\n"}, {"content": "Global airlines start suspending flights to China amidst deadly coronavirus outbreak.

SINGAPORE — The Covid-19 outbreak is “starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere around the world”, at which point it will not be possible to shut Singapore out from the world, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday (March 6). \n “What we might do, even when (the disease) becomes more prevalent around the world, is to maintain some level of surveillance as we are doing today at the checkpoints to pick out and identify people with symptoms. \n “That might still be one level of control that we can do at the borders, but beyond that, we do need to do more within our own community in Singapore to slow the spread of the virus,” said Mr Wong at a press conference by the Multi-Ministry Task Force that is tackling the virus outbreak, which he co-chairs. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who also co-chairs the taskforce; Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli; and MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak were also present at the conference held at the National Press Centre. \n Mr Wong was addressing a question about the continued relevance of border controls and travel restrictions, following fresh measures issued on Tuesday to bar the entry of foreign visitors with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy and South Korea, which have been identified as epidemic centres for the disease outside China. \n “You have got to look at two categories: (The first) are the countries that we have already put in place travel restrictions, because we have identified these to be epidemic centres, starting with China and later expanded to a few other countries. To the extent that these countries take effective containment measures... then at some point in time, I think border controls to these countries will no longer be so relevant,” he said, referring to China and South Korea. \n Mr Wong said China has been working hard to contain the virus and the number of new cases have gone down, while South Korea is taking proactive testing measures and is also vigilant in containing the spread to other cities. \n When deciding on whether to lift travel restrictions on these visitors, Singapore will consider “if the situation within these countries is clearly very well contained” and look at other data and evidence. \n The second part is whether to impose new border control measures, such as travel restrictions, targeting new epidemic centres of Covid-19, he said. \n “I will not rule it out at this stage, but if you think and project ahead, and indeed if the virus is spreading and not that we have one clear epidemic centre and there are epidemics all around the world and it becomes a global pandemic, then there is no basis for putting together border controls unless we shut ourselves, which we don’t want to,” he said. \n Whether Singapore decides to impose these new bans depends on the evolving situation and the usefulness of such restrictions, added Mr Wong. \n “At that stage, the bigger risk is not importation of cases from these countries, but the importation of cases from countries that may not have travel restrictions… We are now seeing more cases coming from Europe, we are starting to see more cases in America, so it is starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere in the world,” he said. \n Addressing a question on whether lifting these measures at a time when Singapore deems fit to do so would inadvertently cause a surge of visitors from places previously seen as high-risk, Mr Gan said it was important not to see Singapore’s approach to border controls in a “binary way”, since its actions have been incremental. \n This is evident in how Singapore has gradually ramped up its restrictions from Wuhan - where Covid-19 was first reported - to Hubei province and then to the rest of mainland China, he said. \n Mr Gan also noted how at the checkpoints, Singapore first rolled out temperature screening measures, and later increasing these measures to also conduct swab tests at the borders. \n “Even for countries that we have border controls, we may adjust incrementally so it doesn’t mean that if we open the floodgates (by lowering travel restrictions), everybody will come in overnight,” said Mr Gan. \n He urged Singaporeans to keep up on personal hygiene efforts, emphasising the critical importance of the new SG Clean campaign launched earlier last month. \n A new taskforce, headed by the Minist\nry of the Environment and Water Resources, was announced Friday (March 6) to encourage good personal hygiene, adjust social norms and raise cleaning standards across the country. \n Mr Gan said besides measures such as border controls, the SG Clean campaign is in fact Singapore’s first line of defence. \n He said: “Whether we have temperature screening or swab tests, it is not a hundred per cent. Even if we have restrictions on travel (from certain countries), we will also have Singaporeans coming back and we can’t stop them from returning to Singapore. \n “Therefore, personal hygiene and public health standards are the most important (moves) and that is why we need to push ahead with SG Clean,” he said. \n GLOBAL PANDEMIC AN ‘EMOTIVE’ TERM \n The World Health Organization (WHO), although avoiding any reference to Covid-19 as a pandemic so far, has nevertheless called upon the world to be prepared for one. \n It currently refers to Covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. A pandemic, according to WHO definitions, refers to “the worldwide spread of a new disease”. \n In a separate interview following the press conference, MOH’s Associate Professor Mak was asked if Singapore would be making representations to the WHO on calling Covid-19 a pandemic. \n Dr Mak said the use of the term carries highly emotive overtones, as well as the notion that countries or continents have failed to control the spread of infections within their borders. \n “As the WHO has said, there is significant potential for a pandemic to arise, but we may not have reached a stage where individual countries and their local efforts to contain it have failed,” said Dr Mak. He added that it is perhaps more helpful to look at how individual countries are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, and how viruses transmits from one country to another. \n On its part, Singapore is collaborating and sharing best practices to tackle Covid-19 with other countries, he said. There is also the possibility to coordinate national strategies across borders on how to respond to the virus — the health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore have formed a joint working committee to fight Covid-19, for example. \n “These are areas that we continue to look at seriously and we continue to be in discussion with international health authorities, our sister (agencies) in the region and further out, to see how we can share information and align our measures,” he said.\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 2-Airlines at centre of storm as coronavirus spreads.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of 24-hour mental health support telephone hotlines have sprung up in China in recent weeks as millions of people fret about catching the coronavirus - and try to avoid infection by staying at home.\nMedical professionals welcomed the launch of several official services in a country where mental health remains a relatively taboo subject, but cautioned that unofficial talk lines could do more harm than good.\n“There are a lot of hotlines out there staffed by a lot of volunteers but it just doesn’t make sense because there’s not many that can be well-trained,” said Cui Erjing, a Seattle-based volunteer for one of the hotlines, who is originally from China’s Southern Guangdong province.\n“It can be really traumatising to ask for support but not get the right responses.”\nA survey by the Chinese Psychology Society published by state media last week found that of 18,000 people tested for anxiety related to the coronavirus outbreak, 42.6% registered a positive response.

China’s central bank, for example, has already pumped liquidity into its economy.\n“Our base case is that the virus can be largely controlled by end-March,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n“The negative impact on the economy will be mostly confined to 1Q,” he wrote, predicting that growth would rebound from March on the release of suppressed demand and monetary and fiscal policy support.\nMSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat.\nEarlier, Asian shares had earlier risen towards their second straight week of gains, helped by hopes governments will make provisions to soften the impact on their economies from the coronavirus epidemic.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.1% for a weekly gain of almost 2%.

The German army has quarantined more than 100 Germans after their return from the Chinese city of Wuhan in a barracks in the South Pole Germersheim. They had landed in Frankfurt on Saturday evening with a German army machine and had been transported by several buses to the training station of the Luftwaffe, which now serves as a quarantine station. There, the returnees are to remain under medical supervision for at least two weeks. This is to ensure that the Coronavirus that broke out in China about a month ago does not spread. In addition to the Germans there were 22-Chinese, an American and a Romanian on board the machine.\nEleven of the total 124 passengers had been taken to the Frankfurt University Hospital after an examination at the airport, one of them a patient whose doctors cannot rule out a coronary virus disease. For the other ten there were other medical reasons, said Hessen's Social Minister Kai Klose. The authorities stressed that the risk to the population was low.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Also at\nOther infectious diseases are particularly at risk for people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nSo far, nine Germans have been infected with the new virus. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth disease on Saturday, while Spain announced that a German tourist had contracted the Coronavirus. The Coronavirus has an incubation period of\nup to two weeks, in\nwhich do not yet show any symptoms. Nevertheless, there may be an infection.\nThe German return flight from Wuhan triggered diplomatic tensions with Russia. The Bundeswehrmaschine was originally supposed to land in Moscow. For this purpose, Russian aviation authorities had also envisaged land licensing. In the end, however, Russia had refused the stopover and this was due to Moscow airport's capacity shortages, said Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU). The Minister announced a possible follow-up.\nIn Russia on Friday the\nfirst cases of Coronavirus. How many other countries have\nRussia is therefore tightening up entry arrangements for Chinese.

Moreover, China will no longer be working visas for Chinese\nexhibition. The measures were aimed at'the security of the country and the protection of public health'. It is also intended to prevent the spread of the new Coronavirus. These were \"temporary\" restrictions, the government stressed. The People's Republic is the\nRussia's main trading partner.\nIn China, the epidemic continues to spread. On Saturday, the country experienced the highest increase in infections and deaths in one day. The Beijing Health Commission reported an increase in nearly 2.000 new patients and 45 deaths. According to the Authority, 304 people in the People's Republic died of respiratory disease. More than 13.700 people have been infected all over China. The 45-new dead come from the particularly affected province of Hubei.\nFrom Wuhan the virus has spread to 24 other countries. As the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported on Sunday, an infected person died for the first time outside China in the Philippine capital Manila. It was a Chinese man from Wuhan.\nIn view of the emergency, the European Union has sent twelve tonnes of protective clothing to China. As the EU Commission said, the People's Republic had asked for the aid. The EU Emergency Coordination Centre has made contact with EU countries.

It's very harmful,\" Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n \"Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats.\" \n Mr Cui's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party's official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China's political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry's Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name \"the lizard king\" that Covid-19 has been around in America \"for a while\". \n The user is described as an \"fl transplant to the desert\", a \"mama\" and \"not an expert\". \n The ministry spokesman's statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and has blamed the US's outbreak on the Asian country's early failures to control the disease. \n \"As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers,\" Mr Trump told reporters March 18. \"That can't happen.

The three days of the funeral ceremonies took place in a hospital room in Cheongdo, heavily hit by the coronavirus.\nMore than 150 sect members have been contaminated. The first case was a 61-year-old woman who ignored being infected and will have transmitted the virus by participating in religious rituals.\nSouth Korea's health authorities have insisted that, so far, the epidemic is still in a controllable phase.\nThe Covid-19 coronavirus has already caused two.345 deaths in mainland China and more than 76 thousand infected worldwide.\nIn addition to the victims on the Chinese continent, four people died in Iran, three in Japan, two in the Chinese region of Hong Kong, two in South Korea, one in the Philippines, one in France, one in Taiwan and one in Italy.\n"}, {"content": "Fighting what's viral in coronavirus episode. By Mohd Harith Mohd NizarKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 -- The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cluster outbreak is not the only thing that is keeping the Ministry of Health (MOH) preoccupied right now.Viral fake news, speculations and rumours relating to the matter have also been keeping the ministry busy. Out of sheer frustration, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad pointed it out to the media: “We have two problems at hand...one is the virus, but the more pressing one is the viral fake news on the spread of the virus.”An example of the misleading fact that Dzulkefly highlighted to the media was the accusations by many netizens that Malaysia is not serious in tackling the problem as is has yet to bar incoming tourists from China.Dzulkefly pointed out Malaysia adheres to the International Health Regulation (IHR) 2005 and therefore any such action could only be taken based on the recommendation of  the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).The health minister said this after making a working visit to the KL International Airport (KLIA) and KLIA2 in Sepang today.Prior to this, the MOH had dismissed fake news that a prisoner had died after eating Mandarin oranges infected with the virus and that a Malaysian student who returned from Wuhan had been warded in Ipoh.If that is not enough, a picture showing a plane full of China nationals arriving in Langkawi to escape the coronavirus back home had also gone viral over the social media, creating alarm and unnecessary trepidation. However, the tour company that brought in the crowd denied the allegation saying they were just the tour agency's passengers from Nanjing, China.   Even the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) today issued a warning that stern action will be taken against irresponsible parties who spread fake content or news or rumours on the coronavirus.Meanwhile, China's Xinhua News Agency said the republic’s health authorities today announced 80 deaths and 2,744 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, with 461 in critical conditions.Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, and seven other nearby cities remain in lockdown to stop the spread of the disease. So far, the United States, France, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Japan Nepal, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam had also reported confirmed cases of the coronavirus but in limited numbers.-- BERNAMA\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China’s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n“Nobody knows the damage China’s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n“The lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren’t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n“I think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,” said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government’s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n“We do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n“Compared to 2003’s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.”\nSince then, China’s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world’s factory before.\nChina’s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n“Every day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,” noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. “For the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)\n"}, {"content": "What we need to know about the unnamed Chinese virus: the risks, the care and how Portugal is prepared. Reporting of the emergence of a new virus in a fish and seafood market in Wuhan, a city in central China, has caused international alarm. The memories of SARS and MERS are still fresh, two other coronaviruses. Both deaths that have arisen in the present century have caused many deaths before they were finally controlled. The new virus, which for the time being has no name but causes family symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties and has already led to dozens of pneumonia, does not seem to have the same potential to kill. Of the infected people already confirmed, one died and was already severely weakened by other diseases. In more than 700 people who have had contact with patients, including health professionals, none seem to have been contaminated. However, The possibility of limited transmission within families is not ruled out, and this week the World Health Organisation has warned hospitals around the world that the new virus may spread, a fear fuelled by the massive displacement of people who will accompany the Chinese New Year celebrations until January 25th. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health said this Wednesday that there is no cause for alarm. The Express spoke to Raquel Guiomar, who recommends: \"Whenever someone goes to a hospital or a medical practice and has a respiratory infection, you should mention if you have taken any recent trips, in particular to China, where cases of this virus have been identified.\"\nWhat steps are being taken by the Ricardo Jorge Institute to address the potential threat of this virus? At the level of the laboratory diagnosis, which is the mission of this institute, we are following all the indications given by international networks, notably by the World Health Organisation, and we are establishing specific laboratory diagnosis for this coronavirus. The diagnosis recommended by the WHO was released on Tuesday and we are implementing it to make it quickly available. In addition to diagnosis, we are following other WHO guidelines. In all suspected cases, linked to the source of the outbreak in China, these patients and their products will be tested for the most common viral agents associated with respiratory infections- and of which the institute has a large number of diagnoses, including influenza, other human coronavirus, adenovirus for influenza, and also coronaviruses that were associated with outbreaks at the beginning of the two thousand years and now more recently, in particular MERS and coronavirus SARS. In all these suspicious cases it is also recommended to do a search for bacterial respiratory agents and even other agents, such as opportunistic fungi. So that will be the follow-up. The institute has also implemented a methodology that allows the genome of either bacteria or viruses or fungi in biological samples and will allow us to identify this new virus.\nWhat symptoms can cause a person to draw attention as a potential carrier of the new virus? What has been recommended, not only to clinics but also to patients, is that whenever someone goes to a hospital or a medical practice and has a respiratory infection, it should indicate whether they have made any recent trips, in particular to China, where cases of this virus have been identified. And, as in suspect cases of MERS coronavirus, it must be ensured that until the laboratory diagnosis, as a negative or positive case, is confirmed, the patient is in isolation. This evaluation is carried out by the Directorate-General for Health and by doctors who have this function. Initial information was reported that it had not yet been confirmed that the virus could be transmitted between humans. Meanwhile, there was the case of that person who did not pass through the market in Wuhan, where the outbreak would have started, and yet contracted the virus. After all, can there be human to human transmission?\n"}, {"content": "south africa's ramaphosa declares state of disaster over covid-19. CAPE TOWN - South African president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster on Sunday as he announced a range of measures to contain a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 61 and showed the first signs of internal transmission.  \n In a live television broadcast after a special cabinet meeting, Ramaphosa said the outbreak, first detected on March 5, could have a significant and \"potentially lasting\" impact on a struggling economy, which is already in recession.  \n Measures to be taken include travel bans to countries such as Italy, Germany, China and the United States. The government will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people and cancel large events and celebrations, he said.  \n \"It is concerning we are now dealing with internal transmission of the virus. This situation calls for an extraordinary response, there can be no half measures,\" Ramaphosa said.  \n He said government has cancelled visas to visitors from high-risk countries from Sunday, with previously granted visas also revoked.  \n \"Any foreign national who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,\" he said, adding that South Africans who visited targeted countries would be subjected to testing and quarantine when returning home.  \n First detected two weeks ago with a single positive result, the number of cases has risen to 61 by Sunday, a mushrooming rate that mirrors the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.  \n The health ministry said earlier it had conducted 1,476 tests, with no fatalities. On Sunday, one of South Africa's top universities, Wits in the economic heartland Gauteng, instructed 350 students to immediately self-quarantine for two weeks after a classmate tested positive for COVID-19.  \n Besides the health impacts, Ramaphosa said the economy would not be spared as exports decline in key markets, including China, and the labour-intensive tourism sector suffers.  \n \"Cabinet is therefore in the process of finalising a comprehensive package of interventions to mitigate the expected impact of COVID-19 on the economy,\" he said. REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "China virus outbreak may wallop economy, financial markets. BANGKOK (AP) – News that a new virus that has afflicted hundreds of people in central China can spread between humans has rattled financial markets and raised concern it might wallop the economy just as it might be regaining momentum.Health authorities across Asia have been stepping up surveillance and other precautions to prevent a repeat of the disruptions and deaths during the 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, which caused USD40 billion-USD50 billion in losses from reduced travel and spending.The first cases of what has been identified as a novel coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but it now is also thought to be spread between people. As of yesterday, some 440 people were confirmed infected and nine had died from the illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms.A retreat in financial markets on Tuesday was followed by a rebound yesterday, as investors snapped up bargains. Share benchmarks were mostly higher, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gaining 1.1 per cent and the Shanghai Composite index advancing 0.4 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7 per cent.While the new virus appears much less dangerous than SARS, “the most significant Asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold, which could multiply the disease diffusion,” said Chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp Stephen Innes. “So, while the risk is returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the Lunar New Year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion.”The 2003 outbreak of SARS in China, along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu, resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many Chinese cities and in Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died, a mortality rate of under 10 per cent.While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread. That’s especially true during the annual mass travel of the Lunar New Year festival, which begins this week.“The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,” Innes said in a report.In China, health officials stepped up screening for fevers. “We ask the public to avoid crowds and minimise the public gatherings to reduce the possibility of cross infection,” Deputy Director of the National Health Commission Li Bin said yesterday. Just as with SARS, though, the impact of the disease is likely to fall heaviest on specific industries, such as hotels and airlines, railways and other leisure businesses and retailers, analysts said. Most declined on Tuesday but rebounded yesterday as investors locked in profits ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The outbreak is a boon, meanwhile, for pharmaceutical companies and makers of protective masks and other medical gear.“If the pneumonia couldn’t be contained in the short term, we expect China’s retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in the first and second quarters,” said Ning Zhang of UBS. Government efforts to offset the shock would help, but growth will likely rebound less than earlier forecast, Zhang said.As of January 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not recommended any international restrictions on travel but urged local authorities to work with the travel industry to help prevent the disease from spreading while warning travellers who fall ill to seek medical attention.The illness is yet another blow for Hong Kong, whose economy is reeling from months of often violent anti-government protests. The wider concern is China, where the economy grew at a 30-year low 6.1 per cent annual pace in 2019. An interim trade pact between Beijing and Washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports. The virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature.“According to our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus, which so far appears very similar to 2019-nCoV (the new virus), we expect increased downward pressure on China’s growth, particularly in the\nservices sector,” Ting Lu and other analysts at Nomura in Hong Kong said in a commentary.The growing number of global travellers has contributed to the spread of various diseases in recent years, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, the Ebola and Zika viruses, the plague, measles and other highly contagious illnesses.The World Economic Forum estimates that pandemics — cross-border outbreaks like the flu that killed 50 million people a century ago — have the potential to cause a USD570 billion in annual economic losses.The 2014-16 Ebola virus epidemic caused losses amounting to over USD2.2 billion, according to the World Bank. That includes a 40 per cent decrease in the number of working Liberians at the height of the crisis, lower exports and harvests, and costs for combating the disease.\n"}, {"content": "US army might have brought coronavirus to Wuhan, says China government spokesperson.

Cases have been detected as far away as the United States.\nContrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China’s communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year.\nAfter a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\n“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAs it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan’s local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances.\nThe measure was intended to “effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the health and safety of the people,” state media cited Wuhan’s virus task-force as saying.\nWuhan’s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a “very strong” measure that could minimize the risk of contagion.\n“If Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread community transmission in this central China megacity & transport hub,” Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet.\nWith more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China’s main industrial and commercial center, home to the country’s largest inland port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.\nThe latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.\nHowever, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.\nThe official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the forefront in fighting this health crisis under the leadership of its Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Since December 31, 2019, when WHO was first informed about pneumonia cases in Wuhan emanating from \"unknown causes\", the WHO has been actively monitoring the situation and holding consultations at different levels.\nThese include declaring the outbreak an international health emergency, mobilising the international scientific community to come together to fight coronavirus, and issuing safety precautions and guidelines for general public, businesses, governments, hospitals and other stakeholders, among other measures.\nAs WHO chief, Dr Ghebreyesus flew in to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts is already operating in China. Dr Ghebreyesus has also been interacting with world leaders, spearheading calls for research collaborations and raising funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.\nBut these efforts by the WHO in the face of a global health emergency, about which very little is known, seem to be of little consideration for a section of society that has unleashed a brutal attack against Dr Ghebreyesus on social media.\nThe attack is not only personal in nature, but also seeks to tarnish his professional image by questioning his credentials and commitment.\n'CHINA'S LAP DOG'\nDr Ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with China in its \"propaganda\" to hush-up coronavirus cases. Many have gone on to call him \"China's lap dog\", say he is \"irresponsible and coward\", and accuse him of \"jeopardising the world for his private profit\", among other charges.\nThe WHO chief's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its \"determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak\" too have not gone down well with many social media users.\nThe petition blames Dr Ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak.\n\"We strongly think he is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. We call for the immediate resignation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A lot of us are really disappointed. We believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral,\" the petition reads. Its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable.\nIn short, Dr Ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts:\nMISPLACED ANGER\nPeople's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the WHO or its chief. In times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis.\nHurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation, but rather often proves to be counterproductive. It infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation.\nSecondly, one may have a hundred differences with China and what its political system and leadership stands for. But is this really the time to attack and malign the nation?\nBefore attacking Dr Ghebreyesus for meeting President Xi Jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, Dr Ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. With regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if China is not on board.\nFaced with such a sensitive situation, the WHO chief cannot afford to upset the Chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.\nThose who are calling Dr Ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think China would have allowed a WHO team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted\nPresident Xi and talked bitter about him.\nThe reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in China. Many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. Priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.\nDr Ghebreyesus's success in convincing China to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. If at all China deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations.\nWhy do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? Those leading the vitriol online attack against the WHO and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-China campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services.\nThe other reason why the WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that Dr Ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date.\nThose forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international emergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. Far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. Even before declaring it an international health emergency, the WHO had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in China.\nHowever, none of this means China, the WHO or Dr Ghebreyesus are above questioning. One must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so.\n"}, {"content": "PSI20 and European fellowships suffer from fears of infection of the Chinese virus.

Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, said in a study this month that Indonesia should strengthen outbreak surveillance and control — especially as it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n The Harvard team said Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases \"may suggest the potential for undetected cases\" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. \n WHO IS \"QUITE CONFIDENT\" \n Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. \n Indonesia has tested relatively few people in comparison to some neighbours and its population, but Mr Putranto said tests were conducted when \"doctors determine they have symptoms that point to that direction.\" \n \"Imagine if everybody who had a cough or flu was checked, then millions would be checked,\" he said. \n Mr Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the World Health Organization's Indonesia representative, has said the WHO was \"quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.\" \n Separately, Indonesia will send a Garuda Indonesia plane in the next few days to Japan to pick up 68 of its citizens working aboard the coronavirus-affected Diamond Princess, officials said. \n The crew could be quarantined for up to 28 days on Sebaru island in the Java Sea north off Jakarta, where 188 crew members from another cruise ship are also being held in quarantine. \n The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China.

Taiwan has called China \"vile\" for not allowing it real time information about the virus from the WHO.

HANOI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus dock and disembark its passengers, the Holland America Line said on Wednesday.\nFor nearly two weeks, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers, had been sailing throughout Asia after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,100 people, almost all of them in China.\n“We will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,” Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Reuters.\n“There will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive alongside,” said Smit.\nThe ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia around 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, he said.\nThe latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, had been Thailand, where the health minister refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock.\n“The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,” Angela Jones, a business consultant from the U.S. state of Georgia, told Reuters in a video recording sent before the news that Cambodia would take the ship. “I’ve asked others who say they are napping a lot.”\nLike many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.\nTo kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship’s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.\nPeople could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.\nOther activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship’s activity programme seen by Reuters.\nPassengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N). There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.\nStoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship’s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nLate on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.\nEarlier, the Thai Navy “Bhumibol Adulyadej” warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic.\nDespite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit “We Are Family” by Sister Sledge.\nElsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship’s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home.\n“Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,” said Jones. “It’s funny and sad at the same time”.\n"}, {"content": "US, China trade barbs over 'Chinese Virus'. United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended calling the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world the \"Chinese Virus\" and said that he is pushing back against the false narrative of China that the US military did this.\n\n\"Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China,\" the president told reporters at a White House news conference.\n\"So I think it's a very accurate term. I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody,\" Trump said.\nAn hour later, he started his meeting with CEOs of the hotel and tourism industry by using the term \"China Virus\".\nTrump refuted the notion that his using of the phrase created a stigma against the Chinese.\n\"I don't think so. I think saying that our military did to them creates a stigma,\" he asserted.\nDuring the news conference, Trump said he took the right decision by imposing a travel ban on China.\nHe replied in the negative when asked about disruption in the supply chain given that many precursors for pharmaceuticals come from China.\n\"No, I don't see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well,\" Trump said.\nThe US President said he did not expect China not honouring its trade deal commitment of buying things from the US as a result of the coronavirus.\n\"Well they need our product very badly... We have a good relationship with China. We have a signed agreement. They're going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product,\" he said.\nRight now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. \"But we are looking at some alternatives,\" he added.\nThe US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.\nIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being \"particularly affected by the Chinese Virus\".\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were \"being hit hard by the Chinese Virus\".\nTrump's allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the \"Chinese coronavirus\", but Beijing said it was \"strongly indignant\" over the phrase, which it called \"a kind of stigmatization\".\nThe US should \"immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using \"racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears.\"\nThe war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.\nTrump's comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.\n\"Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fuelling more bigotry,\" tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.\nThe World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.\nThe new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China's own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.\nBut China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US\", the State Department said.\nPompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added.\nThe State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing's promot\nion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US.\n\"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a \"stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail\", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.\n"}, {"content": "why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.  \n Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION? There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.  \n It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd <TEVA.TA>, Mylan NV <MYL.O> and Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmed\nical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums. \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at Arizona-based Banner Health.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment-advisors are increasingly worried that U.S. authorities are not be doing enough to prevent a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in the country, potentially adding further downside to already-battered markets.\nTheir criticisms include the number of people so far tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which some say is too small, the possible difficulties of imposing lockdowns on U.S. cities and concerns that the White House could bungle containment efforts.\nThe worries have magnified the uncertainty that has accompanied the coronavirus outbreak over the last several weeks, as investors scramble to adjust their portfolios to price in the virus’ potential for damage to the global economy and assess its further impact on asset prices.\nThe CDC states on its website that “as of Feb. 24, CDC teams are working with the Department of Homeland Security at 11 airports where all flights from China are being directed to screen travelers returning to the United States, and to refer them to U.S. health departments for oversight of self-monitoring.”\nU.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said as of Thursday morning the CDC had tested 3,625 specimens for the fast-moving virus.\nFor some investors and analysts, those assurances ring hollow.\n“Much of what we’ve seen about this virus has shaken confidence in governments,” said James Bianco, head of Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research.\nHis list includes doubts over China’s accuracy in counting cases, criticism over Japan’s handling of a cruise ship quarantine at one of its ports, and the comparatively small number of people that U.S. authorities have so far tested.\nWorries over the growing number of cases outside China sent the S&P 500 into intraday correction territory on Thursday morning. Stocks took an earlier hit on Wednesday after health officials in Nassau County, New York, said they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the coronavirus. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases so far. [L2N2AQ192]\nOn Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump told Americans that the risk from coronavirus remained “very low,” and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to run the U.S. response to the looming global health crisis.\nBianco said he fears many investors are still complacent about how quickly the number of cases could multiply in the United States, as it has in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.\nHe is advising his clients to tread lightly until the full extent of the outbreak is known.\n“I would rather risk a lost opportunity by being out of the market or underweight and finding out that this is not a big deal, than being fully invested and worrying that this will get worse,” Bianco said.\nOthers are concerned over the consequences if the United States were forced to implement a lockdown similar to the one imposed by Chinese authorities on Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nWuhan, Hubei’s capital, imposed strict controls on movement of residents, then eased them, then later announced that the relaxation had been revoked. Such measures could be more difficult to enforce in the United States.\n“Those of us sitting here in Hong Kong looking at financial markets think there is a tremendous amount of risk in the system,” said Simon Powell, equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.\nPowell is particularly worried that there could be spread of the virus from people from countries outside China which were not subject to travel restrictions coming into the United States. He is particularly concerned about the outbreak in Iran.\nIran said on Thursday that its coronavirus death toll had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China. The death rate among confirmed cases of the virus has been running at around 10% in Iran compared to around 3% elsewhere.\nPowell also thinks that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity , writing in a recent research note that “our base case hypothesis is that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity, and supply chain disruption, so spread of the virus, if it were to emerge in the US, would be more likely.”\nOthers have pointed to what they believe are shortcomings in the CDC’s approach.\n“The initial response from the U.S. has been targeted to mount a res\nponse to confirmed high-risk or infected cases, not directed to a more generalized public health containment,” said Wouter Jongbloed, head of policy and risk analysis at New York-based Exante Data.\nWith coronavirus having spread well outside China, CDC testing was “likely insufficiently effective in preventing a potential outbreak in the U.S.,” Jongbloed said.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak stops supply of Chinese products, Mumbai traders wary of future.

BEIJING — US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (March 18) doubled down on his recent use of the term “Chinese virus” to refer to Covid-19, saying he was simply referring to the virus’ place of origin and that the expression was not racist. \n In a show of defiance against Chinese anger over the use of the term, the president used it within seconds of the start of the daily press conference of his Covid-19 task force, saying: “There’s some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus”. \n “No, no, it’s not racist at all … It comes from China,” Mr Trump said when asked why he was using the term amid rising reports of racism against Americans of Chinese ethnicity. \n “I have great love for all of the people from our country but, as you know, China tried to say at one point … that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I am president. It comes from China,” Mr Trump said. \n “Not think; I know,” he said when asked again whether it was definitive that the virus originated from China. \n Last Thursday, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, wrote on Twitter that the virus may have originated from the US Army, which took part in Military World Games in Wuhan last October. In response, the US summoned China’s Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai this week to complain about the tweet. \n In posts on the social media platform, which is banned in China, Zhao also shared articles from the Canadian conspiracy site Global Research that suggested Covid-19 had originated in the US. \n At Wednesday’s media conference, Mr Trump demurred when asked about a CBS reporter’s Twitter post on Tuesday that a White House official had referred to the virus as “Kung Flu” during a private conversation. “No, not at all,” he said when asked if the term put Asian-Americans at risk. “They probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it comes from China.” \n Mr Trump also said he had no plans to ease tariffs on China, amid calls for him to do so by American industry groups. “China is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that,” the president said. \n The press conference – the third consecutive daily briefing fronted by Mr Trump — saw a continuation of his dramatic shift of tone regarding the virus, after weeks of downplaying its severity. “We're going to defeat the invisible enemy, I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought,” Mr Trump said. “And it will be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory.” \n The president’s comments came as already-strained ties between the two superpowers further soured this week, with both sides trading barbs — and conspiracy theories — over who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. \n China has reacted with fury at Trump’s and his Republican allies’ insistence on calling the ailment the “Chinese coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus”. \n Those names ignore the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) repeated calls for all countries to use the officially assigned terminology — Covid-19 for the disease, and SARS-CoV-2 for the virus that causes the illness. \n While epidemics’ names in the past had been based on where most of the infections occurred, the WHO in 2015 issued new guidelines to avoid contagions being identified by geography; the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was one such example. \n The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in a statement on Tuesday said referring to Covid-19 as the “Chinese virus” was akin to “telling people who to blame, they are telling people who to fear and who to hate”. \n “Unfortunately, we have already seen how this bigotry has impacted Asian-Americans across the country who are facing increased prejudice and violence,” the group said, adding that many from the community had been assaulted to the point of requiring medical care in hospitals. \n “This is the consequence of spreading xenophobia, something that cannot continue to be amplified by the Trump administration and Republican members. Not now, not ever.” \n China, too, has fanned diplomatic flames. In recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists. \n Beijing also provoked anger in\nWashington on Tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 American journalists from China by revoking their visas in retaliation for Washington’s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five Chinese state-owned media outlets. \n The Chinese action affects journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. \n Asked for reaction to the journalists’ impending expulsion, Mr Trump — who frequently disparages “fake news” outlets he does not like — said: “I am not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don't like seeing that at all.” SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus may have infected 500,000 in Wuhan by peak in coming weeks. MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - The new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. Recent trends in reported cases in Wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" of virus cases in Wuhan, Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email Sunday (Feb 9). \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n That would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, Kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. The prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in Wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred. \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of midnight Sunday. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-nCoV after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation. \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Lipkin, who recently returned to the U.S. from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures tak\nen so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Ryan said. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.\n"}, {"content": "Minister of Agriculture regrets misinterpretation of her coronavirus statements.

Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it's indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses.

Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular.

In late January, South Korean health officials summoned representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their Lunar New Year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside Seoul's busy train station.\nOne of the country's top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: South Korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in China. He promised the companies swift regulatory approval.\nThough there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, \"we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,\" one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.\n\"We acted like an army,\" he said.\nA week after the January 27 meeting, South Korea's CDC approved one company's diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centres and ability to test thousands of people daily.\nSouth Korea's swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections.\nNew cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.\nThe United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea's, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.\nAs a result, US officials don't fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 US cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Centre.\nThe delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the US economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.\n\"It makes me feel like I'm living in a farce,\" said Dr Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can't get a test, she said. \"We are a rich country but we don't have these kinds of things?\"\nThe administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, US health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty.\nThen, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the US Food and Drug Administration didn't approve tests other than the CDC's until February 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.\nMeanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.\nSouth Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States' FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.\n\"There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. \"But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\"\nIn a statement, CDC spokesman B\nenjamin Haynes said, \"This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\" But he said \"more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system's ability to detect and respond to cases.\"\nBombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency's revised policy.\nBut it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.\n\"The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. \"That is a failing. Let's admit it.\"\nIt's a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.\n\"I don't know how we messed this up so badly,\" said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \"We got caught flat-footed. For America, that's unacceptable.\"\n'HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS'\nAt the pivotal January 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for take-off.\n\"They were told that the 'emergency use authorization' would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\" said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.\nOne of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on February 4.\n\"The government acted quickly,\" said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC \"disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\"\nLee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.\nSouth Korea's rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.\nThe country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.\n\"We can't ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,\" the Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said. \"We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\"\n'A REAL FOUL UP'\nOn January 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.\nHHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.\nOn February 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.\nThough coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.\nIn his remarks, Dr Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA's review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency's mission to protect public health: \"It's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\"\nCarolyn Hiller, a program director at th\ne Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.\n\"The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\" she said.\nStenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \"specific topic on the agenda.\" But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \"the conference was timely and addressed issues important\" to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.\nThe following day, February 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.\nWeeks of chaos would follow.\nBy February 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC's test wasn't working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.\nAs of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn't immediately deploy their own without the FDA's blessing.\nHHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC's initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency's lab. The precise problem has not been identified.\nThe CDC didn't send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.\nThe US emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.\nThe declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for Covid-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.\nThat's because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.\n\"Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Health Security. \"There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States' pandemic response plan.\"\nDr William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.\n\"Traditional public health thinking is, 'Don't create widespread panic and don't go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,'\" Schaffner said. \"That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the US system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\"\nIn a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: \"After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem . CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\"\nThe CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.\nThe CDC was \"not an impediment\" to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial US cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.\nAlberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA's office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \"There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\" Gutierrez said. \"The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?\"\n\"The FDA had good intentions,\" he said.\nRAMPING UP\nIn mid-February, cases spiked a\nt a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On February 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.\nAs of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on February 29.\nThe country went from two approved test makers on February 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.\n\"To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\" Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said.\nPLEADING WITH WASHINGTON\nBy February 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for \"enforcement discretion\" so they could use their own lab-developed tests.\n\"We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\" Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on February 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.\nIn an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \"Hail Mary\" pass, an act of desperation.\n\"The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\" Becker told Reuters.\nThat same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.\nOn March 2, Stenzel at the FDA's diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.\nAs US regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.\nAt a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, US Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.\n\"Why don't we have drive-through testing like South Korea?\" Ruiz asked leaders of the president's coronavirus task force.\nRuiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.\nIn recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.\nDespite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. \"I think months have been lost here,\" Ruiz said. \"Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea's tests.\"\nThat may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the Covid-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the US market.\n\"The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\" Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.\n(Chad Terhune reported from Los Angeles; Dan Levine and Jane Lee reported from San Francisco and Hyunjoo Jin from South Korea.

'The Commission is following the situation very closely and we continue to coordinate the measures that may be needed at EU level', said today the spokesman for the EU executive Stefan de Keersmaecker, speaking at the daily press conference of the institution in Brussels.\nAccording to the responsible party, \"the Commission is ready to take whatever precautions are necessary to comply with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted at today's meeting\" of that entity.\nStefan de Keersmaecker specified that, this morning, the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, talked to the WHO Director-General and the French and Italian Health Ministers about this virus.\nIn addition, according to this spokesman, internal meetings are taking place in the European Commission on the subject.\n\"Yesterday [Wednesday], the Commission held a second meeting of the public health committee, which discussed the level of risk and potential consequences for the EU\", exemplified Stefan de Keersmaecker.\nThe virus is still being monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, a European body that identifies health threats and that has \"increased the risk of this virus entering the EU from bottom to moderate\", said the spokesman, explaining that this was due to the risk of transmission from person to person.\nThe new virus causing viral pneumonias was detected in China at the end of 2019 and has already infected several hundred people and caused death to at least 17.\nThis is a new type of coronavirus, which is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to human beings, but still in totally substantiated circumstances.\nThe first cases of the 2019-nCoV virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan's seafood and meat market in the same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, transmitting it to humans.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\nThe WHO decided on Wednesday to extend until today the meeting of the Emergency Committee to decide whether the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is declaring an international public health emergency.\n"}, {"content": "Origin, symptoms, lethality... What we know as the new virus in China. The emergence of a new 2019-ncov coronavirus in Wuhan, China, triggered one of the biggest health crises in recent years. Next is the certainty and outstanding issues about this episode.\nHow did the outbreak begin?\nOn December 31 last year, Chinese authorities reported 27 cases of unexplained pneumonia, of which 7 were serious. The people affected are obviously related to a market in Wuhan, a metropolis with a population of 11 million. On January 7, the cause of the disease was identified as a new coronavirus. A few days later, China reported that the pathogen could spread from person to person.\nWhat symptoms does the virus cause?\nThe virus infects the respiratory tract, causing symptoms ranging from mild symptoms (dry cough, fever, etc.) to acute respiratory failure and life-threatening pneumonia.\nHow does it spread?\nThe exact mechanism has not been determined, although the most accepted form is through contact and small salivary droplets excreted by virus carriers when they cough. This infectious disease occurs between people no more than one meter away from us.\nAre there any symptomatic cases?\nIt is not clear, although experts believe it is possible, just like other similar viruses.\nIs there any treatment?\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine, although several projects are under way. Health care focuses on symptoms and patient life support. Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, baloxavir, ribavirin and acyclovir are ineffective against the virus. China is studying the combined use of lobinavir and ritonavir.\nHow to diagnose?\nChina announced the gene sequence of the virus on January 10, three days after the virus identification. This has enabled us to develop a specific diagnostic protocol for use by all Member States. Without these analyses, it is almost impossible to distinguish it from other types of pneumonia and even influenza. Large hospitals have a technology called PCR that can confirm viral infection within a few hours, although in Spain, official confirmation depends on the National Microbiology center.\nWhat is the evolution of disease?\nThe number of people affected has been increasing since December 31 last year, and the trend in China and other countries is rising.\nHas the virus spread rapidly?\nExperts stressed that the virus spread fast. In less than a month, by January 29, more than 6000 cases had been registered in China, and more than 5300 cases had been diagnosed with SARS.\nWhat is coronavirus?\nThey are a large family of viruses that affect humans and various animals. So far, six acquaintances may make a person sick: four cause common cold, one is SARS (also appeared in China in 2002) and mers (in Saudi Arabia in 2012). Coronaviruses only affect some species and may mutate, enabling them to jump to other species and be toxic to humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused more than 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (mers) caused 2500 confirmed cases and 850 deaths. So far, studies have shown that both originated in bats, which is also the main hypothesis of Wuhan bats.\nWhat is the lethality of Wuhan new virus?\nExperts pointed out that according to the early available data, the mortality of this new pathogen is lower than that of similar viruses, ranging from 2% to 3%. According to who, the mortality rate of SARS virus is between 10% and 18%, while the mortality rate of SRM is as high as 35%.\nWill the virus mutate and become more toxic?\nThe World Health Organization warned that although each virus is prone to mutation, it has been quite stable since its discovery, which cannot be ruled out.\nWhat measures have been taken?\nChina has decided to implement quarantine in Wuhan and more than a dozen nearby places. Wuhan has been inaccessible since the early morning of last week. They widely use masks. Overall, it limits more than 46 million people\nPeople. Airports in most Asian countries, as well as airports in the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, have developed control measures to detect passengers with compatible symptoms from affected areas. Wuhan airport was almost closed.\nWho's doing what?\nThe organization has monitored the evolution of the epidemic almost from the first day because it lists coronavirus as one of the threats of a future global pandemic. The emergency committee has held two meetings. Despite great differences of views, it has not yet decided to declare an international state of emergency, although in the last week of January, the Committee has changed the global threat rating of the virus from \"medium\" to \"high\".\nWhat does the international declaration of emergency mean?\nPublic health emergencies of international importance were declared in response to outbreaks of \"serious, sudden, unusual and unexpected\" situations with health consequences beyond the affected countries. The declaration launched a process that made it possible to take immediate and concerted international action. Who has made this decision five times: influenza A in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in West Africa in 2014, Zika in 2016 and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last July.\nIs Spain in danger?\nThe Ministry of health believes that \"considering the inspection conducted by the Chinese authorities, the risk of introducing the virus into Spain is considered to be very low.\" in any case, even if the virus arrives, \"the impact on public health\" will be \"very low\".\nWhat's the name of the new coronavirus?\nAt present, it has a temporary 2019-ncov (new virus in 2019), but who will decide the last one. Usually, they are named after the place where they were found, so they are likely to be Wuhan virus.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus triggers sales of books \"The Plague\" and \"Blindness Test\" in Italy. The epidemic of Covid-19, caused by a new coronavirus, triggered the online sales of the novels \"The Plague\" by Albert Camus, and Joseph Saramago's \"Blindness Test\" in Italy, the most affected European country.\nIn times of fear of the new coronavirus detected in December in China, various cultural events and equipment have already been cancelled in order to avoid propagation, but on the other hand, the search for books, films, series or games that address the topic of pandemics has been increasing since the beginning of the year.\nThe latest indicators show an increase in book sales such as \"The Plague\" (1947), written by Franco-Algerian writer Albert Camus, Nobel Prize winner for Literature, whose 60th anniversary of death is noted this year, who is talking about a plague epidemic in the 1940s, which quickly takes over the whole city of Oron in Algeria.\nSubject to quarantine, this city becomes an unbridled territory and its inhabitants are led into states of suffering, madness, but also compassion.\nLast month in Italy-- the most affected European country, with three.089 cases of confirmed infection, over fifty thousand people were quarantined due to the Covid-19 outbreak.\nIn this country, Camus'book rose to the third place in portal ibs' top sales, when a month ago it was in 71st place, it reported the Italian newspaper \"La Repubblica\", in advance that the Amazon platform also recorded an increase in the book ranking in the category of classics, tripling sales.\nIn France, something similar happened, with 8.889 copies of \"The Plague\" being sold in the first two months of the year, when all last year the total sales were in the 22.400, according to the Edistat book sales statistics portal.\nAlso Joseph Saramago's \"Blindness Test\" (1995), a writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature three years later, became a literary phenomenon in Italy, having reached the top-10 of ibs and Amazon's 5th place, with an increase in 180% in sales.\nThe story tells of an epidemic of white blindness, which begins with a man inexplicably blinded when he is inside the car in the middle of traffic, and which spreads like a powder fuse, until collective blindness.\nA situation similar to the search for these books is happening with films like Steven Soderbergh's \"Contagion\" (2011), in which a woman returning from a business trip to Hong Kong dies of a supposed flu, but the virus spreads and the deadly epidemic spreads, with doctors running out of time to try to identify the virus and fight it and stop the panic of the population.\n\"Contagion\" is already among the ten most watched films on iTunes and among the fifteen most downloaded, according to Google Trends.\nThe Netflix documentary \"Pandemia\", which features heroes in a battle against flu and their work to prevent an outbreak around the world, which is not caused by the coronavirus, but shows that the world health system is not prepared to face a global health crisis, has also become a central issue on Twitter.\nAnd as fear sells, various predictions are already on social media, one of which is reported in the novel \"The Eyes of Darkness\", by American science fiction writer Dean Koontz.\nPublished in 1981, with a reimpression in 1989, the book has a chapter on a disease called Wuhan-400, which is actually a biological weapon created in that Chinese city.\nThe page describing the consequences of the virus itself has become viral, especially on Twitter: \"They call it Wuhan-400 because it was created in one of the RDNA research laboratories outside the city of Wuhan, and it was the No.400 strain of man-made micro-organisms created in that center. Wuhan is the perfect weapon. It only affects human beings. No other living thing can be a carrier.\"\nViral also became an image of the \"Asterix in Italy\" comic, published in 2017, where a driver named Coronavirus takes part in a chariot race, although it has nothing to do with any disease, being only a curiosity of name and country.\nIn these days of searching for catastrophic omens, also a warning from Bill Gates, made in February of 2017, was put into circulation. At the time, Microsoft's cofounder said that a pathogen that spreads through the air and moves quickly \"could kill more than\n30 million people in less than a year\", although earlier in 2015, he had warned during a lecture that the world was not prepared\"for a next epidemic\".\nThe most catastrophic is the description written by Sylvia Browne in her 2008 book \"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World\", which also spread through social networks, according to which a respiratory disease would erupt throughout the planet in the year 2020, and would not disappear until ten years had passed.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, which can cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused about three.300 deaths and infected more than 95 thousand people in 79 countries, including eight in Portugal.\nFrom infected people, more than fifty thousand have recovered.\nIn addition to three.012 killed in China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States of America and the Philippines, San Marino, Iraq, Switzerland and Spain.\nA Portuguese crewman of a cruise ship is hospitalized in Japan for confirmation of infection.\nIn Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed eight cases of infection, of which six in Porto, one in Coimbra and one in Lisbon.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to \"very high\".\n"}, {"content": "What we don’t yet know about the coronavirus. (Reuters) - It has been only three months since reports first emerged from China of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.\nBut there’s still a lot they don’t know.\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors – as well as policymakers and economists – are still trying to answer:\nHow contagious is the virus?\nThe virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. There is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.\nHow many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?\nSo far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. That would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. But we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.\nGraphic: Tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here\nAre younger people less likely to die from the virus?\nYounger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop COVID-19 - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. Just how much safer they are is still unanswered. The WHO says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a U.S. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. Health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.\nCan people be re-infected?\nThis is a key question – and we don’t yet know the answer. There are a handful of cases of possible “reinfection” in recovered patients. But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. A patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. Fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don’t know how long those antibodies will last. With some viruses, antibodies fade faster. Even if they do persist, SARS-CoV-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.\nSeveral academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. Serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.\nDo we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?\nNo. So far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. Treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. Companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. A few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. Another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. Some scientists have already identified subtle changes since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. But recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.\nDoes the virus spread more slowly in hot places?\nSome experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. But the European Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. The WHO has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.\nHow long will the pandemic last?\nWe d\non’t know. It will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. President Donald Trump said this week that he hopes to “reopen” the U.S. economy by Easter Sunday on April 12. But he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. In Hubei province, the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. It remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.\nDoes the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?\nViruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. At the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.\nWhen will the economy return to normal?\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. Economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last – around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown – and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.\nAre the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?\nCentral bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. Such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.\nIs it a good time to invest?\nSome investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world’s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in February. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was “redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.” But with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.\nGraphic: COVID-19 in the United States, here\n"}, {"content": "Weak economic data, coronavirus spook investors. \nThere seems to be little respite in sight for the markets - which have just seen their worst week in a decade - as the impact of coronavirus has started reflecting in economic data.\nFactory activity in China, the global engine of growth, has contracted at the fastest pace on record with China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) falling to a fresh low of 35.7 in February against 50 in January.\nFurther, China and South Korea continued to report more coronavirus cases over the weekend, while  the US, Australia, and Thailand reported their first cases of death.\n“It’s going to be a tough period,” said Shankar Sharma, founder and vice-chairman of First Global.\n“Coronavirus is a serious problem and can lop off quite a bit from global growth.”\nThe Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 per cent on Friday - the biggest single-day fall since 2015 - to end at 38,297 and 11,202, respectively.\nBoth indices are down nearly 9 per cent from their all-time highs in mid-January.\nOn previous occasions, indices have rebounded sharply after a near-10 per cent drop.\nHowever, a sharp reversal seems difficult this time as the peak impact of the virus is yet to play out.\nThe India VIX surged 31 per cent on Friday, a sign that traders expect the markets - which are back to October levels - to remain highly volatile.\nFurther, most global indices have entered “correction zone”, posting a 10 per cent decline from recent highs.\nMany don’t rule out a “bear market” - a fall of 20 per cent from highs - if the World Health Organization’s (WHO) warning of a global pandemic comes true.\nThe US markets fell 4 per cent in intra-day trade on Friday, before paring losses to end 1.4 per cent lower.\nIn addition, the US 10-year Treasury hit a record low of 1.114 per cent, before settling at 1.163 per cent.\nMarket players say such low reading on the 10-year Treasury is a sign of extreme anxiety.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out close to Rs 12,000 crore last week.\nDomestic investors pumped in an even higher amount, but it did little to stem the fall in share prices.\nSharma said overseas investors typically “chase momentum” and there isn’t much predictability to their flows.\nAs regards a recovery, market players have not ruled out a bounce-back on account of technical factors such as short-covering.\n“Historically, global events that have caused a meltdown in markets have proved lucrative investment opportunities.\n\"The key point to remember is that we do not know for how long the current crisis may play out.\n\"Therefore, while investing in such times, it is better to make staggered investments,” said S Naren, executive director and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC\n"}, {"content": "RPT-China's online censors tighten grip after brief coronavirus respite. (Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absen\nce.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing “server not found” or “404”.\n“404+404+404+404+404=2020,” said the shared post.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s local governments are ramping up surveillance efforts with new data collection campaigns to better trace residents’ moves in public areas, seeking to curb the coronavirus outbreak but heightening privacy concerns.\nAt least 15 provinces and cities with a combined population of over 358 million have announced such “big data” measures this month, adding to a host of monitoring tools already being used, such as facial recognition and phone data tracking.\nVisitors to office buildings, shopping malls, residential compounds and metro systems are now being asked to scan QR codes using their mobile phones and fill in forms asking for information such as their travel history and body temperature, according to residents and local media reports.\nSome regions are also instructing residents to use newly launched features by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat apps.

Western diplomats and activists have criticised China’s use of mass surveillance in the past.\n“Of course governments have the responsibility to protect public health and safety but these measures have to balance other rights as well, including privacy rights,” said Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n“Some of these criteria are very broad, and when you use this criteria and feed it into the app, how accurate are they?”\nSome government officials acknowledge privacy concerns and have offered reassurances.\nLiu Yuewen, who heads Yunnan province’s department of public security’s big data expert group, said individuals’ privacy would be protected, and the data would be destroyed when efforts to control the epidemic end.\n“No one will be able to see any data without the permission of the epidemic prevention and control headquarters,” he said, according to a report by the state-backed Beijing News.\nSome accounts have shed light on how the information is being used by authorities.\nOne video shared online showed residential committee officials telling residents in one apartment they needed to head to a Beijing hotel to be quarantined for 14 days.\n“Big data has shown you to be a close contact of an infected person,” said the officials in the video, which Reuters was unable to verify. An employee at the hotel named in the video told Reuters it was not currently open to the public.\nOther people who say they have been quarantined using big data have questioned its accuracy.\nA Hangzhou resident who only wanted to be identified by his surname Hu told Reuters police came to his house and said he was detected as being in contact with someone infected by the coronavirus.\nBut Hu said he had not met face-to-face with the infected person, who was a friend, and they last spoke in November through a messaging app. Hu is now in quarantine at his home.\n“My residential committee and the police station understand the situation but can not help me,” he said.\nIt was unclear whether all the data collected goes to a central depository or was analysed on a national level, as local authorities often used their own systems made by different companies.\nThe Binhai New Area in the coastal city of Tianjin, for instance, uses a platform made by Tianjin Teda Smart City Technology Co.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thousands of people have died, the United States response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the \"globalist\" order. \n \"When the dust settles on the Covid-19 world, we won't be in the same place that we were just a week ago,\" said Mr Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n \"We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,\" he said. \n Mr Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of Covid-19, late on Wednesday (March 11) abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the \"foreign virus\". Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted - which Mr Trump acknowledged. \n Ms Kelly Magsamen, the vice-president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Centre for American Progress, said Mr Trump's move would only increase questions about Washington's historic leadership role. \n \"I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges - whether it's a pandemic or whether it's climate change or nonproliferation?\" she said. \n \"It's going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.\" \n Covid-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan - likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat - and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm. \n But China in the past week has sought to turn its Covid-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread. \n China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive. \n It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing's influence in all areas. \n An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei. \n China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the US. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. \n The Trump administration, which has offered US$100 million (S$141 million) in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with Covid-19. \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the \"Wuhan virus\" and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the US will \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.\" \n Mr Michael Green, who was the top Asia adviser to former president George W. Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its \"arguments about the failures of democracy\". \n But he added: \"That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.\" \n \"While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,\" said Mr Green, now a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \n In one example, Mr Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea's contributions to US bases, with Mr Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments. \n One broader effect, Mr Green said, may be a shifting political narrative. \n Mr Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors - much like Americans across party lines have hailed Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Trump's 2016 upset win, Britain's vote to leave the Eu\nropean Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof \"that the technocrats failed\" following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Mr Green said. \n \"I think it's very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it's the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,\" Mr Green said. \n \"We'll see. But that may be how political history turns in this chapter.\"\n"}, {"content": "g20 leaders pledge s$7.2tn in 'united' response to coronavirus crisis.

A doctor from Mumbai has sought help from the Indian government to get his mother's body back from China, which is hit by the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe body has been kept at the morgue of a hospital in Zhengzhou since January 24, when Rita Rajinder Mehra died.\nDentist Puneet Mehra, 35, told PTI that the Indian Embassy in Beijing informed him on Monday that the transportation of his mother's body has got delayed in view of the restrictions on movement of people and vehicles in China after the outbreak of coronavirus epidemic in the neighbouring country.\nThe Bandra-based doctor has, thus, sought desperate help from the central government to get back his mother's body at the earliest so that her last rites can be performed in Mumbai with due respect.\nAccording to the doctor, on January 24, he and his mother were travelling from Melbourne to Mumbai via Beijing on Air China flight.\nAfter about nine hours of the flight take-off, his mother went to the lavatory but did not return for a long time, following which Mehra alerted the crew.\nThe lavatory door was later opened and Mehra's mother was found in an unconscious state, he said.\nA doctor and a nurse, who were among the passengers, and the crew tried cardiopulmonary resuscitation and later the plane made an emergency landing at Zhengzhou Airport, but she had died by then, he said.\nPuneet Mehra returned on February 7, but his mother's body is still at the morgue of Henan Provincial Hospital in Zhengzhou.\nThe doctor has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, office of the External Affairs Ministry and the Ambassador of India in Beijing to help in getting back the body.\n\"I have also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and requested the government to facilitate the process of transportation of my mother's remains back to Mumbai at the earliest so that the last rites can be performed with due respect,\" Mehra said.\nHe said this situation has caused a lot of stress to him and my family.\n\"It has been over 24 days now and we are extremely shattered and going through a lot of emotional stress in this helpless situation,\" he said.\nHe said the hospital in China initially issued a certificate mentioning the cause of his mother's demise as 'death before rescue'.\nAfter three days, the hospital gave Mehra another certificate mentioning the cause as 'sudden cardiac death very likely'.\nLater, another certificate was issued mentioning the cause as 'sudden death', he said.\nMehra further said he got a reply from Arvind Kumar (Consular) at the Embassy of India in China, saying the embassy is also very concerned about the issue and has full sympathy with the family at this tragic time.\nBut, China is also facing an equally tragic situation.\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic has 'completely derailed normal life' in China, particularly in Hubei and adjoining provinces, due to severity of the spread and number of deaths that have taken place so far, he said.\nIn a bid to contain spread of the virus, the Chinese government has put up widespread and severe restrictions on the movement of people and vehicles.\nThis has resulted in hardest obstacles in inter-provincial movement of people and vehicles. Hence, there is a delay in transportation of the mortal remains of Rita Rajinder Mehra to India by the agency hired by Puneet Mehra, Kumar said in his reply.\nThe consular also said that as per the existing regulations in China, funeral homes in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou only are authorised to carry out embalming and anti-sepsis procedures of mortal remains of a foreigner for air transportation.\nAs of now, the Chinese government has placed complete restrictions on the funeral homes from accepting a body from any place out of these three cities.

Hong Kong/Canada/New York (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Private organizations and government agencies are scrambling to implement business continuity planning (BCP) measures for the 2019 novel coronavirus, an infectious disease that came into broader public knowledge mere weeks ago.\nTo date, more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been documented worldwide, with the majority of the cases clustered in Hubei province, China. To try to curb infection rates, the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures, including travel restrictions and quarantine measures, to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions.\nDevelopments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility, succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play.\nIn mainland China, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2, to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices, such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday, are legal.\nEnterprise Singapore, a government agency, has issued a guide{here} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers, including communications, human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times.\nIn practice, segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees, even outside working hours. For example, the South China Morning Post, an English language newspaper in Hong Kong, established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months.\nMany companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases, partially due to containment measures from the local government, lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region’s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas.\nIn comparison, there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea, Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel.\nIn Canada, some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill, or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations, especially smaller firms, may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus.\nInternationally, businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{here}, where manufacturing and logistics acti\nvity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M, Japan Airlines, Baidu Inc, McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses.\nBCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor.\nSome important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough.\nBusinesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities.\nMoreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness.\nPlanning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Helen Chan, Regulatory Intelligence)\n"}, {"content": "Breakingviews - China’s viral immune system open to economic pox. HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s political system has weak immunity to viruses. A bungled swine flu cover-up doubled pork prices last year. Now a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia is panicking citizens just days before the start of what’s usually a $150 billion spending boom: the lunar new year holiday. President Xi Jinping’s corruption purge may have made officials less venal, but not, apparently, more credible.\nConcealing epidemics, environmental crises, and product scandals was once reflexive behaviour for local governments. Burying bad news can head off career-ending popular protests. Now officials must manage the flow of facts and rumour about a virus that emerged in Wuhan, a large city in central China.\nWhen it comes to infectious disease, local censorship slows medical response and facilitates transmission. That’s what happened with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a coronavirus similar to that found in Wuhan. SARS killed nearly 800 people, docked a percentage point from China’s economic growth, and erased up to $18 billion in travel, tourism and retail sales in Asia, according to one academic estimate.\nBeijing scored transparency points with its handling of the H7N9 avian flu in 2013, but then fumbled its response to African swine flu, which some officials initially tried to cover up. Around half of China’s herd had to be culled.\nDistrust is a tax that distorts consumption. After the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, some residents of the provincial capital disregarded official reassurances, hoarding bottled water and camping outside for months on end, refusing to believe their buildings were safe. The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan caused a bizarre rush on iodized salt in China.\nThe coronavirus has already killed four and infected hundreds. It has spread overseas. With an estimated 400 million Chinese planning to travel for the holiday, the question is how many will still go and spend.\nXi’s massive purge of corrupt officials made him popular, but it was packaged with tighter control of media, and suppression of negative economic commentary. This encourages officials to report only good news, so some will naturally try to control disease outbreaks before they become public. When that backfires, the result is personal tragedy and economic waste.\n"}, {"content": "The radio program explains satire regarding the coronavirus that revolted Chinese community.

But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus - or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus - was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus - which has spread to several countries - as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009. \n  \n “After SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. \n “I think we are much better prepared now.” \n Currently, Singapore is at DORS condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory - SARS and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n COMMAND AND CONTROL \n SARS first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospita\nl (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said. \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture - you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n  \n INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was - in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - “flying blind”. \n During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to\ndepend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,” she added. \n  \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During SARS, TTSH was known as “SARSCentral”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n  \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n  \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan viru\ns could be worse than SARS given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added. \n  \n Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available - robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu. \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it - this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”. \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS \n Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”. \n  \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation fro\nm happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said. \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all … There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n  \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening … But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS , can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION \n Compared with the SARS crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.” \n This will be critical during the “surge response” - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possi\nble quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters - mostly residents - also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for SARSbut info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information - and accurate information - is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "Studies show that there's a coronavirus-carrying animal. Know which one. A team of Chinese scientists has demonstrated that pangolins are carriers of coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which causes the current pandemic, but not enough to conclude that they are directly responsible for transmitting the virus to humans.\nSARS-CoV-2 emerged in a market in Wuhan (China) where wild animals were sold and, although there is evidence to suggest that bats are the reservoir of the syndrome, today scientists still do not know which animal may be the intermediate guest that facilitated the transmission of the virus to humans.\nToday, a genomic study, led by Chinese virologists Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong, and Yan-Ling Hu of the University of Medicine of Guangxi, published in Nature magazine, advances that Malaysian pangolins carry coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.\nThe similarity between these coronaviruses and what caused the pandemic is not sufficient to confirm that the pangolins are the guests who transmitted the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans, but the findings suggest that these wild mammals are \"a second guest of the coronavirus,\" Therefore, the sale on the wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to prevent future transmissions, warns scientists.\nIn the study, they recall that shortly after the outbreak, the Wuhan market- the initial focus of the infection- was dismantled, which prevented gathering the animal species in which the coronavirus originated.\nA possible guest could be the pangolim, the most trafficked mammal that is used as food and in traditional Chinese medicine.\nFor the job, Yi Guan and colleagues analyzed samples of 18 Malaysian pangolins seized in smuggling operations in southern China between August 2017 and January 2018, and all of them found different types of coronavirus.\nThe virus from these samples bore a genetic similarity between 85% to 92% with SARS-CoV-2.\nIn addition, in one of these viruses, the region that facilitates cell entry is very similar to that of the current virus.\nHowever, none of the pangolin coronavirus had the specific modification of human SARS-CoV-2, which raises doubts that pangolins are directly responsible for transmitting the coronavirus to humans.\nNevertheless, the authors of the study warn that pangolins should not sell themselves in markets and prop o se greater surveillance of these animals to understand their role in the emergence of coronavirus potential to infect humans.\nThe new coronavirus, responsible for the covid-19's pandemic, has already infected more 480.000 people around the world, of whom about 22.000 have died.\nAfter appearing in China in December, the outbreak spread throughout the world, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation.\nThe European continent, with almost 260.000 infected, is the one where the largest number of cases are currently emerging.

SINGAPORE — As Singapore steps up the battle against Covid-19, with the outbreak still largely contained, some people living here are worried about their relatives in corners of the globe that are suffering the worst death tolls from the virus outside China. \n These people — originally from Italy, Iran and South Korea — are glued to their television and mobile phone screens, constantly refreshing their social media feeds for the latest news back home, where the death toll has risen alarmingly in recent weeks. \n For some of them, the anxiety of being so far from loved ones at such a difficult time has been made harder by insensitive humour over Covid-19 on social media. \n Italy has more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases, with a death toll of 52. In Iran, 66 people have died, with reported infections topping 1,500. And in South Korea, 28 people have died with more than 5,000 cases reported. \n The Ministry of Health said on Tuesday (March 3) that all new visitors who have travelled to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Singapore from 11:59pm on Wednesday, after the World Health Organization named these three countries, alongside Japan, as the ones of greatest concern in the fight against Covid-19. \n Ms Hayedeh, 50, who declined to give her family name, moved to Singapore from Iran more than 30 years ago. She feels “helpless” about the situation in Iran. \n “When the virus started in Singapore, I took it a lot better because I saw how Singapore handled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003). I don’t feel worried because I know I am in good hands. The Government is taking care of everything in an amazing way,” the home chef, who is a permanent resident, said. \n “But I’m worried for them (in Iran) because it’s a huge country. The number of people and awareness is different.”  \n Mr Mohammad Jafari, 56, a businessman who moved to Singapore from Iran in 1993 shares the same sentiments. \n “When the virus started spreading here, my brother (in Iran) told me to be careful. They were worried because Singapore is close to China and many Chinese people visit Singapore. I told them not to worry because Singapore has the situation under control, implementing effective quarantine measures,” Mr Jafari, who has been a Singapore citizen for more than 15 years, said. \n Ms Hayedeh remains worried about her friends and family who are avoiding social gatherings and staying home, but she refrains from calling them “more than usual” because she does not want to “give them stress or anxiety.” \n A sense of excitement that should be felt with the Iranian New Year, or Nowruz, being just around the corner on March 20, is replaced by largely empty roads and even emptier stores there. \n Ms Hayedeh said: “No one has the mood to go out to shop. Like Chinese New Year, before Nowruz, everybody goes out to shop, buy new clothes, food, sweets and house decorations. Businesses are very affected.” \n Researcher Alireza Javadian, 34, who is here on an employment pass, said: “Many travel agencies that sold tour packages to visitors hoping to go to Iran to celebrate the new year received a lot of cancellations.” \n  \n Mr Alireza Javadian, an Iranian who is a researcher on an employment pass in Singapore, during a visit to Cambodia. Photo: Alireza Javadian \n Ms Hayedeh thinks that Nowruz will be celebrated “in a different manner” this year. “Usually on Nowruz, we gather and hug and kiss but this year, they cannot even do that anymore,” she said. \n 'SAD FOR PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA' \n Ms Kim Ye Sing, 24, who is a Singaporean permanent resident, said that both the Singaporean and South Korean authorities are handling the outbreak well. She also said that living here made her realise \"how ready Singapore is to fight and protect its people”. \n She used to work as a flight cabin crew and is moving to the banking field. \n “I’m very sure the government in South Korea also did the best it could to contain the virus but it was already spreading so quickly,” she said. \n “The official in charge of managing Covid-19 even commited suicide. It just shows how troubled the official was.” \n She added: “I feel really worried and sad for my people in (South Korea). I hope things will get better soon.” \n Two weeks ago, a South Korean undergraduate, Ms Eunbin Cho, 22, had to cancel her flight to Seoul on March 11 to visit her fa\nmily there but could not obtain a refund because there were no official travel restrictions at that time. \n She said that she is worried about her family being there as the number of infections keep going up. \n “Today I saw that there were five new cases at the exact location where my grandparents and parents are living, in Gangnam (a district in Seoul). It’s so bad,” she told TODAY on Monday. “There are confirmed cases everywhere.” \n Ms Cho said that she is deeply saddened by the situation in South Korea and was upset to see comments on Facebook making jokes about it. \n On a Facebook page of a Singapore media outlet, she found comments that were \"very bad\", trying to be funny and saying things such as \"Train to Daegu\", an apparent reference to Train to Busan, a Korean zombie film. \n “But it’s not funny at all,” she said. “They keep making fun of it by saying it’s like a Korean drama.

The new coronavirus may infect at least one in twenty people in the city of Wuhan, China, when a peak is reached in the coming weeks, according to scientists who have established models for the spread of the virus.\nThe trend borne in the cases reported in Wuhan \"largely supports\" the mathematical models that the London School of Hygiene Tropical is using to predict the transmission of the dynamic epidemic, according to the scientists of this institution, cited this Sunday by the Bloomberg financial information agency.\n\"Assuming current trends continue, we are projecting a peak in mid/late February\" in Wuhan, said associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology Adam Kucharski at the London School of Hygiene Tropical, quoted by Bloomberg.\nKucharski, who works with mathematical analysis on infectious disease outbreaks, explained that \"there is a lot of uncertainty, so be careful about choosing a single value for the peak, but it is possible based on current data to see a peak of prevalence above 5%.\nWuhan, the Chinese city where the 2019-nCoV virus appeared at the end of last year, has been quarantined since the 23 of January, and the movement of 11 million people is restricted.\nHealth authorities in China and around the world are anxious to know whether the largest known quarantine in the world is effective in containing pneumonia caused by the new virus in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, where 60 million people live.\nMapping the worldwide coronavirus outbreak, Kucharski and his colleagues at the British institution based their models on a set of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus.\nThese include an incubation period of five,2 days, delay in the onset of symptoms to confirm 6,1-day infection and the risk of infection between the ten million people who have been identified as the most vulnerable in Wuhan.\nBased on that data, a prevalence of 5% is about 500.000 total infections. In other words, often more than the 14.982 cases, which the provincial health authorities had reported in Wuhan up to 20:00 on Saturday night in China.\n\"The next two weeks are really critical of understanding what is happening\", said Benjamin Cowling, the head of epidemiology and bioestatics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday quoted by Bloomberg.\nThey will also be critical, he warned, to know \"whether the virus is spreading elsewhere or whether we have avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures adopted and implemented so far\".\nThe number of deaths resulting from the pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) rises to 813, of which 811 in mainland China, where the number of infected exceeds 37 thousand.\nIn the 24-hour run-up to the balance sheet this Sunday, the Chinese authorities recorded on mainland territory 89 deaths and 2.656 new cases of infection with the coronavirus found in December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre), placed under quarantine.\nThe new balance is already beyond the Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 has caused the death of 774 people around the world, most of whom in China, but the mortality rate remains lower.\nSo far, the only two deaths caused by the new coronavirus registered outside mainland China have occurred in the Philippines and Hong Kong.\nIn addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more than 350 cases of contagion confirmed in 25 countries. In Europe, the number arrived on Sunday at 39, with two new infections detected in Spain in the United Kingdom.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), which declared an international public health emergency in mid-January, indicated on Saturday that cases of contagion reported daily in China are stabilising, but stressed that it was early to conclude that the epidemic had reached its peak.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Central Bank announced this Sunday that it will inject 300 billion yuan (43 billion dollars) next week to help companies involved in the fight against the viral epidemic.\nThe epidemic is paralyzing large areas of the country's economy and threatening them to slow down.\nin economic terms.\nOn Monday, the Bank of China will release the first tranche of special funds to help financial institutions lend to key companies involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic.\nThe lieutenant governor of the Bank of China, Liu Guoqiang, said on the website of the Chinese supervisor that nine major national banks, in addition to local banks in ten provinces and cities, are eligible to contract these funds.\nWe are talking about ten regions including Hubei Province, the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic, as well as Zhejiang, Guangdong, the Beijing capital and the Shanghai financial centre.\n\"This financial boost is intended to help national and local companies,\" said Liu quoted by the agency France Presse.\n"}, {"content": "Study predicts coronavirus killing 15 million people... in the best case scenario.

The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative-pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative-pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n A negative-pressure isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of get\nting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters.

NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and 65 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines.\n"}, {"content": "What restrictions now apply to travellers. As of Monday, the Federal Ministry of Interior (BMI) has ordered temporary border controls. These will take place at the internal borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark.\nGerman nationals, persons with residence status and first domicile in Germany are still allowed to enter Germany. Returning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nNew guidelines for border controls are intended to ensure the free movement of goods within the European internal market. The cross-border movement of goods and professional commuters is therefore guaranteed. The latter are asked to provide evidence of their activities. Passengers \"without valid travel reason\" may no longer enter or leave the abovementioned borders.\nIn individual cases, a personal reason may also be considered \"valid\". It is up to the border police to decide what private cross-border travel they allow. According to BMI, federal police officers are experienced in assessing such individual cases, as this is their daily business.\nIn addition to Germany and many other countries, the European Union will now close all its external borders. Travels between EU countries and other countries are suspended for 30 days. The measure should apply from Tuesday afternoon.\nAccording to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, there are supposed to be exceptions for citizens with a permanent residence permit for the EU. Also for EU citizens, diplomats, doctors, nurses, researchers and experts. And also for people who transport important goods, as well as commuters who work in the EU.\nThe federation and countries want to drastically restrict tourism in Germany. On Monday, the Federal Government decreed that overnight stays such as hotels or hostels in Germany \"can only be used for necessary and explicitly not for tourist purposes\" for the time being. In the evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech, \"that there should be no holiday home or abroad\".\nThe Robert Koch Institute currently includes the following countries: Areas of risk: Italy, Iran, China: Hubei province, South Korea: Gyeongsangbuk-do province, France: Grand Est region (including Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne), Austria: Tirol federal state, Spain: Madrid, USA: California, Washington and New York.\nThe more important question at the moment is: should I still be travelling? The Federal Government's Crisis Staff provides a clear answer by discouraging all unnecessary trips abroad. The reason: Because of the measures taken against the Coronavirus, travellers are at increased risk of not being able to return to Germany without further ado. In addition, further drastic restrictions on air and travel are expected in the short term, writes the Foreign Office.\nIn order to slow down the spread of the new virus, many governments have decided to restrict entry worldwide. For example, Poland has closed its borders to foreigners, international air and train connections have been suspended. The United States has banned all entry from Europe for a 30-day period. The entry ban applies to Europeans who have stayed in the Schengen area within a period of 14 days before entering the United States in Germany or another country.\nOther countries, such as Russia or Romania, are committing German immigrants to a 14-day quarantine. Other states, including India, have declared all visas already issued to German nationals invalid, while Thailand does not (yet) have a hard stop to entry.\nYour country's entry regulations may also change spontaneously at the moment. It is therefore essential that you inform yourself at short notice, for example at the Foreign Office, at the respective national representation in Germany or at the German Embassy in your country of travel. It is also recommended to keep informed about the current status of booked flights with the airlines.\nThis is not\nuniformly regulated. The contracts of some suppliers include a\nPandemic. That is, the V\ninsurance does not have to pay if a customer becomes infected with the relevant pathogen during a pandemic. However, some suppliers do not accept this possibility from Kulanz.\nInsurers are currently checking whether their protection continues to apply when customers in\ntravel a country classified by the Robert Koch Institute as a risk area.\nThe validity of some foreign health insurance could therefore still be restricted. Many insurers now publish FAQs with more information on their website.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) has launched a recovery operation for thousands of Germans who are stuck abroad due to travel restrictions in the Corona crisis. Most Germans, approximately 4.000 to 5.000 persons, are located in Morocco according to the Foreign Office. The Federal Army is not currently involved in the repatriation, as there would be enough aircraft available from Lufthansa, for example. These would be used on behalf of the government.\nThe Foreign Office has formally issued a worldwide travel warning for tourist travel.\nAt Deutsche Bahn, tickets can be exchanged for vouchers, even if they are so-called savings prices or super savings prices. A fee is not appropriate. This applies to tickets before the 13th. They were bought in March and the day of the trip between the 13th. March and 30th. April's lying. The railway has created an online form for this purpose. The application will also be accepted after the day of the trip. Another possibility is to make these tickets flexible up to thirty. Use June on another day. The train's been disconnected. Only city tickets are no longer valid.\nThe German market leader Flixbus will cease operations from Wednesday. The company reported this in Munich. All national and cross-border connections to and from Germany are affected. Passengers affected would be informed about bus crashes, they said. You'd get a voucher for the entire ticket price. The company Blablabus also ceases operations from Wednesday morning.\nLast Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared the whole of Italy a restricted zone. Travel within the country is therefore generally prohibited, but exceptions are possible. In the same way as the measures previously imposed on northern Italy, the restrictions should initially be up to three. April applies. Conte explained: \"Our habits must change now. We must all give up something for the good of Italy.\"\nAll shops have been closed since Thursday except supermarkets and pharmacies. This includes bars and restaurants as well as theatres and museums.\nThe Federal Government advises against all unnecessary trips to Italy after the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) had classified the whole country as a risk area. The Foreign Office has since updated its travel instructions. Previously, the indications only applied to regions particularly affected in the north of the country.\nThe Foreign Office points out that it is still possible to return to a place of residence both inside and outside Italy. Checks and requests by security and law enforcement should, however, be expected. A self-declaration on the need for a journey within the country would have to be completed and accompanied.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no flat-rate answer for all travellers. Contact your tour operator as soon as possible. There you will get information about what you can do if you have booked holidays in countries with travel restrictions. Usually cancellation is free of charge if a travel warning from the Foreign Office is available. As far as the new Coronavirus is concerned, such a warning only applies to the Chinese province of Hubei.\nYou can often cancel your booking even if you have to expect significant changes to your planned trip, writes the Consumer Centre. This applies not only to entry bans, but doubtless even when essential sights cannot be visited. Individual travellers are best able to contact the airlines, railway or bus companies directly and the accommodation already booked or the booking portal used.\n\"If there is a specific danger due to exceptional circumstances, you can cancel for free,\" says the Hamburg lawyer Ol.\niver Matzek, specialist in travel law. Weather or strikes, as well as medical emergencies such as an epidemic, are recognised as exceptional circumstances. In order to find out whether such an exceptional circumstance as a cancellation circumstance is appropriate for your destination, it is best to ask your contractor directly.\nAnyone wishing to cancel an already booked trip for fear of infection, without any specific travel restrictions, can always invoke the cancellation rules agreed upon at the conclusion of the contract, regardless of the Coronavirus.\nIf you do not cancel your trip yourself but, for example, the airline cancels your connection, your ticket price is usually refunded in full. The same applies if a whole package tour is cancelled.\nMost travel cancellation insurance covers only the pre-departure illness, not the risk of possible infection during the journey. You can find the exact terms and conditions of your insurance policy. In principle, you can take out insurance at any time before the first day of your trip, but with a decisive limitation: \"At the time of conclusion of the contract, the insurance case may not have occurred yet,\" explains lawyer Matzek. Thus, existing risks cannot be insured. This also applies to the Corona epidemic, which is particularly important if you are travelling in regions that have already been classified as a risk area.\nReturning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nAnyone who develops symptoms typical of the new Coronavirus within a 14-day period after returning from a risk area should call the emergency medical service, which can be reached nationally under 116117. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but the disease caused by the Coronavirus Covid-19 can vary greatly according to RKI. If you suspect that you are infected, stay at home and do not visit a doctor's office or an emergency room on your own, thereby risking infecting your fellow human beings in doubt.\nAs there are no serious predictions as to how the Coronavirus epidemic is developing, this question is not easy to answer at the moment. Many tour operators pause their program until (first) the end of April and relax their cancellation rules.

If Germans go to Switzerland for skiing holidays soon, it will be emptier than usual in the gondolas and luxury shops. Because the Chinese tourist groups, which have recently become more and more dominant in the street, are staying out. It's the Coronavirus. Many flights to and from China are currently cancelled, two-thirds of Chinese overnight stays in Europe have been cancelled, estimates the European Tourism Association Etoa. What the skiers might be happy about is the hotel owners and boutique operators. Because the Chinese are not only a growing group of travellers, but also a bit crunchy: they spend almost three times as much in Switzerland as German guests, for example, every night.\nCountries with a lot of tourism are therefore the first to be affected by the Coronavirus. But they will not be the only ones.\nThe virus has become a threat to the global economy. This can already be seen in the reactions of the stock markets. It was not only after the New Year's Festival that the courses crashed in China. Nine percent minus recorded the Shanghai Composite Index on Monday. And when the Chinese stock exchanges were closed the week before, the international markets reacted. The German stock index Dax dropped sharply last Monday, then recovered easily to sink again on Thursday. Overall, he lost four percent in the week. The Dow Jones in the United States fell three, five percent that same week. Oil and copper, whose prices always react quickly when the world economy is in danger, also gave way.\nAlthough investors tend to exaggerate, they do pretty well reflect what is currently expected for the future. And the current expectation is: beware, this virus could be contagious. Infectious to the world economy.\nThis is mainly because it broke out in China, a country that is highly intertwined with the rest of the world. For example, on raw materials: 13,5 per cent of the world's crude oil and almost half of the crude steel went there last year. 2002 was only about half as high. China has also gained importance in consumption, which should not be underestimated. Almost every third smartphone is sold in China today and more than every third car.\nThe more intertwined other countries are with China and the world economy, the more dangerous they are if the virus paralyses the Chinese economy for a long time. Germany is hugely globalised, as shown, among other things, by the export surplus, which was last again higher than in all the other countries of the world. The third most important exporting country is China. At the same time, it is the main importing country. With regard to individual industries, the German car industry in particular is strongly linked to China. About every third car sell BMW, Daimler and Co. there, with Volkswagen it is even 40 percent.\nSo the dependence is great. But can the virus actually do so much that the entire German economy can feel it?\nThere are three ways the world economy can harm it. First of all, direct. Since many people have stayed at home due to health risks, since shops have been closed, fitness studios, restaurants and partly entire factories, China's domestic economy has almost stopped for a short time. Foreign companies feel that. Either because they sell less in China or because Chinese tourists cancel. Or if they produce in China themselves because production is out. This can quickly be over when the climax of the infection has passed.\nSecondly, the virus of the global economy can damage Chinese growth. If the epidemic lasts longer and slows its growth over a longer period, it indirectly affects countries associated with China. As a result, companies invest less in China. And countries that produce capital goods, Germany is strong, are hit.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group on the virologist Christian Drosten published\non the Berlin Charite the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe third way is the most unlikely but most dangerous: a panic. If the epidemic develops so dramatically in China, or even worldwide, that investors'confidence falls and prices crash worldwide, this could lead to a financial crisis. This is also being debated because many economists feel that the situation of the world economy is fragile anyway. For example, the American Kenneth Rogoff has long been warning that the risks of a renewed financial crisis are increasing worldwide. In January, prominent economists discussed possible triggers at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association. The virus was not an issue then, but China was. The country is under observation, as it has grown rapidly for years, but has been weakening for a long time now. In the view of some observers, the real estate boom has taken on a dangerous dimension, as has the debt. Sometimes all it takes is a trigger to make the whole situation go away. In particular, the central banks in the world are no longer as strong as they used to be, since they have been heavily powdered in the financial crisis.\nhave shot.\nBut can a virus really be a trigger for such a dramatic crisis? Looking back could be a cause for revelation. The outbreak of Sars in the year 2003, the tsunami in Thailand and Indonesia (2004, 230.000 fatalities) or the reactor disaster in Fukushima (2011) had limited economic consequences. Just a few quarters after the disaster, the economy was back on full swing.\nBut the comparison with these events has its drawbacks. Natural disasters, which destroy houses, factories and roads, often lead to a special phase of growth after a short period of time. Simply because the damage is repaired. Such a special conjuncture is not expected after a wave of illness. Because there are no houses or roads to build.\nThe parallels to the Sars epidemic are also limited. \"One should not make the mistake of focusing on this crisis without reflection,\" says Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Public Value of the Hamburg Commercial Bank. At that time, the courses rose again just as the World Health Organisation called for global health emergencies. Yes, according to de la Rubia, they even started an \"amazing rally.\" Firstly, however, the health consequences are different. Already now, after a few weeks, China counts more deaths due to the new pathogen than during the entire Sars outbreak, which lasted several months. Secondly, the economic conditions are fundamentally different. China was an emerging economic power in the year 2003, but its importance for world trade was even smaller than it is today. 17 years ago, less than five percent of global economic output came from Chinese goods and services, today it is 19th percent. China has also become more important as a purchaser of exports. An economic break-in in China should therefore be felt more strongly internationally than before.\nHow much exactly the German economy could suffer is what Timo Wollmershaus is trying to estimate. He heads the business department of the Ifo Institute in Munich. For this purpose, he uses a software program with hundreds of equations containing data on economic interfaces and previously observed interactions: the Ifo business model. In this programme, Wollmershausen has entered the data for a scenario in which China's economic performance falls by a percentage. That's how bad Sars was.\nThe economic consequences that the Coronavirus would have for Germany would therefore be obvious: in this case, growth in Germany would only decrease by 0.05 per cent. \"If the current epidemic dampens Chinese economic growth twice as much as it did with Sars, it should be about 0.1 per cent lower in Germany.\" So the consequences would be stronger than before, but no drama for the whole economy.\nThe effects could therefore be so obvious, because an epidemic first and foremost dampens consumer demand: travel, restaurant visits, shopping. Much of it is now falling away and is not catching up. \"For Germany, however, it is practically irrelevant if consumption in China decreases,\" says Wollmershaus. \"We hardly deliver consumer goods there.\" Only if the Chinese order fewer machines and fewer cars, the second way the virus can harm the economy, would this be felt for local exports. Often, however, such large purchases are only postponed in a crisis and subsequently followed up.\nThe consequences could be more serious if the supply chains are disrupted. So if China is a longer supplier of products to the local industry. About a tenth of all pre-products and capital goods imported from abroad are purchased by German companies from China. However, the extent to which supply bottlenecks actually occur is not yet foreseeable.\nThis is also difficult to say, because even in China, the experts themselves find it difficult to assess the economic consequences. The streets and shops are now empty not only in Wuhan, where the infection began, but also in other major cities. Many companies have still closed their offices, partly at the behest of local authorities, partly because of their own decision. In some regions, such as Shanghai, workers are expected to continue until nine. February stay at home, in others, such as Beijing, ended the officially extended holiday\ntime at the beginning of this week. \"It is likely that it will not be possible to foresee until the beginning of next week to what extent the employees can return to work in the companies and to what extent there will be problems in the supply chains,\" says Jens Hildebrandt, Managing Director of the German Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Hildebrandt himself is currently working from home.\nIn addition, most projections are still based on the assumption that the new virus will trigger a regional and time-limited crisis. If this is not to be the case, if the deadlock in China lasts longer or Germany is more affected by the virus, then the economic damage can be much more difficult to predict.\nLinks to these and other sources can be found at zeit.de/wq/2020-07.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: From US to India, how nations are tackling economic fallout.

BEIJING (AP) — Scientists in the city at the centre of China’s virus outbreak have applied to patent a drug made by United States (US) company Gilead Science Inc to treat the disease, possibly fuelling conflict over technology policy that helped trigger Washington’s tariff war with Beijing.The government-run Wuhan Institute of Virology said this week it applied for the patent in January along with a military laboratory. An institute statement acknowledged there are “intellectual property barriers” but said it acted to “protect national interests”.Granting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.Yesterday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.Gilead, headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.“Gilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,” said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. “Their application has been filed more than three years after Gilead’s filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.”The institute said its application was filed on January 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.China has the right under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to licence a patent to protect the public.It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.The government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.The institute said it applied for a “use patent” that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug’s target. Gilead’s patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.The Chinese researchers made their patent application “from the perspective of protecting national interests,” said the institute’s statement.“If relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China’s epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,” it said.Gilead said last week it was working with US and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir.

By Mohd Fharkhan Abdul GhaparKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 30  -- Malaysia has been more prepared and proactive, and has also acted faster in containing the novel coronavirus compared to previous times when faced with dangerous infections such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Nipah virus and Ebola.Infectious disease specialist Datuk Dr Christopher K.C. Lee told Bernama yesterday that its experience in containing these past infectious diseases had made Malaysia more prepared to deal with such situations, and this included having more thermal scanners which have been placed at all entry points into the country, as well as its actions in isolating coronavirus cases and placing suspected cases under quarantine.He said swift measures such as these were important in reducing potential local transmissions of the virus in the country.\"Compared to SARS in 2002, when we took weeks to trace the infections, now we have managed to do so much earlier due to our experience, expertise and the technology employed.\"We are now in a containment phase, to prevent any local transmission. The seven cases that have been detected were not infected in Malaysia but overseas, and imported into the country. It is important that we prevent the infections from spreading within the country,\" Dr Lee explained.The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was first detected in December, in Wuhan, China, causing pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties. As of last night, Malaysia had seven confirmed cases.The specialist added that apart from thermal scanners, the dissemination of information to every tourist entering Malaysia, particularly tourists from infected areas, was also important.\"They (tourists) need to be given information about the virus and actions needed such as seeking treatment at specific hospitals if they do not feel well.\"This is important because when they entered Malaysia, they may not have had a fever or other symptoms but may have fallen ill several days later,\" Dr Lee stressed.The specialist who is experienced in handling SARS, Nipah virus and Ebola cases, noted that the outbreak of the virus in affected areas such as Wuhan, had occurred at a faster rate compared to other infectious diseases, and the world still had insufficient data on the new virus.The spread of the virus had been exacerbated by the increased movement of people within and out of China in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations. “It makes things a bit complicated,” he said.Asked about claims that the coronavirus could be spread through its presence on the surface of goods imported from China, Dr Lee said the possibility of such an occurrence was low because many viruses could only last within a particular environment for a period ranging from a few hours to a few days, and this would be dependent on the context.\"Although we do not have enough information on the coronavirus, we believe it is like SARS and influenza which won’t last long in the environment,\" he added. -- BERNAMA \n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus India cases and deaths: Best or worst, this online epidemic calculator shows Covid-19 projections. What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India’s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective,\nthen covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India’s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let’s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let’s also assume that the quarantine doesn’t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt’s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don’t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don’t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don’t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn’t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind.\n"}, {"content": "China has banned trade with wild animals because of Wuhan coronavirus. Just use a few keywords: \"hunting\", \"game\" or \"completely natural\". On some of the most popular Chinese e-commerce platforms so far, you can find the most exotic meat through query. As a civet, the cat spread SARS virus to humans at the price of 350 yuan (46 euros) per kilogram in 2003. Or peacocks. Or giant salamanders. It's not that easy, at least for a while. Since the new coronavirus in Wuhan was transmitted to humans by an animal sold in a market in the city, the Chinese government has just banned the trade and transportation of wild animals, although only temporarily.\nThe joint order issued by the three official entities, including the Ministry of agriculture, prohibits any form of trade with these animals, whether alive or dead, on any platform, although it specifically refers to e-commerce, restaurants, supermarkets or markets. Local authorities will strengthen inspection and impose \"severe\" punishment on those who violate the ban. The farms where these animals are kept will be isolated.\n\"Consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals and must stay away from wild tastes and eat healthily,\" the standard said.\nScientists tracked the source of the new coronavirus, which killed at least 56 people in China, infected more than 2000 people in China alone and more than 30 people in other parts of the world. Although in theory, the South China market - cal and canto closed today - is engaged in the sale of seafood and fish, there are also a variety of cage animals. A price list circulated on social media includes 100 kinds, from wolf cubs to hedgehogs or camel meat. So are marmots, foxes or monkeys. Or snakes, mice, cats and dogs.\nScientists are still unable to determine the exact identity of the species, but they do determine that the 2019-ncov coronavirus was transmitted to humans through animals. A group of Chinese scientists published an article saying that this may be a snake; Others thought it might be bats.\nThe situation is the same as that of SARS in 2003: scientists have determined that the disseminator of coronavirus related to Wuhan coronavirus is civet meat sold in a market in Guangzhou. The epidemic eventually infected 8422 people and killed nearly 800 people.\nAt that time, as now, trade with wild animals was prohibited. But, like now, it's temporary. Interest in consuming these meats has also declined. But temporarily.\nChina is still a greedy consumer of wildlife products, so that the risk of extinction of some species increases. With the prosperity of the country, the demand for food or traditional medicine is also growing. In some industries, eating the most exotic and difficult to obtain meat is a way to show social status. In other cases, such as eating dogs at the Yulin festival in the south, eating this meat is almost an act of claiming ethnic origin.\nMarkets like Wuhan are not uncommon. A survey published by Beijing News last week found that one month after the discovery of the first batch of infectious diseases in Wuhan, it is still possible to find markets willing to sell, restaurants willing to prepare in different provinces, and on Internet forums, Consumers are willing to pay all the price for this food.\nThe problem in these markets is not only the hygienic conditions of raising animals, but also often poor. In addition, it is difficult to determine the source of the copy. Although some farms are licensed to keep these species - it is estimated that there are about 6000 on tiger farms - activists say it is not uncommon for captured wildlife to end up in one of them; Or the license was obtained illegally.\nAlthough the virulence of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak has attracted people's attention.\nThese practices are increasing. Last week, 19 famous scientists sent an open letter to the government asking for restrictions on this trade. \"This is important not only for ecological protection, but also for controlling public health risks,\" they warned. Experts also called for addressing the \"legal gap\" in wildlife domestication and breeding permits that allow traffickers to hunt animals freely and sell them on the market through farms.\n\"Animal borne viruses are the most common human pathogens. They account for less than 15% of all known human pathogen species, but more than 65% of pathogens have been found since 1980,\" Christian Walzer, executive director of the NGO Wildlife Conservation Association, said in a statement. (WCS) is headquartered in New York.\nA Chinese microblog user commented on Twitter: \"if human beings are not harmonious with nature, nature will bring us a blow.\".\nAt present, the ban from Beijing is only temporary. The order issued on Sunday stipulates that the ban will only continue \"until the national epidemic disappears\".\nOrganizations such as the World Health Organization (WCS) claim that \"if these markets continue and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife continues, the public will continue to face greater risks of new viruses, potentially more deadly viruses and sources of future epidemics,\" Walzer said.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Bangladesh suspends visa-on-arrival for Chinese nationals.

SINGAPORE — Banks here have unveiled packages to help companies and other customers with relief assistance to help tide them over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DBS and United Overseas Bank (UOB) said that the packages are aimed at helping small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as other customers. \n A third bank, OCBC, said that it is working closely with customers, whether individuals, SMEs or large corporates, to mitigate the fallout from the outbreak and to help them through this difficult period. \n Multinational bank Standard Chartered (Stanchart), which has operations in Singapore, said that individuals and small businesses here are facing unprecedented challenges in the near to long term, and it will introduce measures for clients who ask for financial assistance. \n DBS on Thursday (Feb 13) said that it conducted a poll of about 100 SME clients in early February to ascertain their top financial concerns and challenges during this time. \n The top concern for most companies, DBS added, was ensuring consistent cash flow to cover ongoing operating costs. \n To address these concerns, DBS said that it will provide liquidity relief packages to address the SMEs’ most urgent cash-flow needs. \n In particular, the bank said that it will provide a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans. \n It will also offer an extension of import facilities of up to 60 days to act as immediate cash-flow support for businesses coping with disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak. \n “These initiatives will be available upon application to customers with good repayment histories,” DBS said, adding that affected retail customers with good repayment histories can apply for a six-month principal repayment moratorium for mortgage loans. \n In its press statement on Thursday, OCBC said that it will offer targeted support measures to assist customers across its core markets affected by the outbreak — including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore. \n These measures include allowing customers to restructure their loans such as home mortgages and business loans, and providing a moratorium on principal repayment for loans such as home mortgages and business loans. \n Besides these, it will be extending the due date of the affected business’ trade finance bills as well as extending bridging loans in the form of more working capital financing to affected businesses. \n Join us on Telegram to get TODAY's top stories on mobile:  \n OCBC’s group chief executive officer Samuel Tsien said: “We will not put a cap on the help that we will extend to our customers. This Covid-19 outbreak is unfortunate and unanticipated. It is our banking and social responsibility to support our customers to help them overcome this market challenge which is not of their own making.”  \n He added: “We will help each of our customers as the case may justify and not on a first-come-first-serve basis. As we at OCBC put it, we must be ‘simply spot on’ on the assistance that our customers need.” \n Relief measures to be introduced by Stanchart include waivers of late payment fee and late interest charges for credit cards and personal loans, as well as late fee and default fee waivers for retail mortgages. \n Mr Dwaipayan Sadhu, Stanchart’s head of retail banking, said: “We understand that this can be a stressful time for everyone and we want to help our clients alleviate some financial burden in the short term, if they need it during this period.” \n On Wednesday, UOB announced that it has allocated S$3 billion to provide companies — especially SMEs — with relief assistance to address their near-term liquidity needs in the face of the likely economic fallout of the virus outbreak. \n The bank’s relief measures aim to enable affected companies — which have good track records and have been servicing their repayments promptly — to have more flexibility in their cash-flow management. \n In its press release, UOB said that the measures would include allowing affected businesses to rework their principal repayments and to service only their loan interest for up to one year; extending up to one year working capital financing of up to S$5 million; and offering financing liquidity against mortgage security. \n UOB’s deputy chairman and CEO Wee Ee Cheong said: “In these particularly trying times, the Government, businesses and communities are doing thei\nr very best to overcome this immediate challenge. We at UOB want to play our part in our commitment to caring for our clients’ businesses.”  \n He added: “For most companies, especially the SMEs, cash flow and financing are key to them sustaining their business. As their long-term banking partner, we believe our added support can help alleviate the business disruption and pressure from the ripple effect of the epidemic.” \n Aside from extending help to the SMEs, UOB said that it will also assess retail customers who are affected by the “current circumstances” on a case-by-case basis. \n OTHER MEASURES IN PLACE \n In its press release on Thursday, DBS said that it is working with partners to provide Singaporeans with subsidised or complimentary services to “navigate these challenging times”.  \n These include partnering with education firm 88Tuition to offer unlimited, free online supplementary lessons for primary and secondary school students from Feb 17 to April 30. This will allow students to continue to take classes while having minimal contact with others. \n The bank also announced a partnership with transport company ComfortDelGro in its initiative to use DBS’ debit or credit cards for street-hail hires, which will help in contact tracing. \n To show solidarity and support to healthcare workers and the broader frontline community, DBS will work with community partners to provide them with tokens of appreciation, such as care packages and food-and-beverages treats. \n Mr Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore country head, said: “In these difficult times, we feel it is incumbent upon us as Singapore’s largest bank to lend a helping hand to our clients and the public-at-large. We hope the liquidity measures will go some way in easing the financial pressure that some individuals and SMEs may face.” \n He added: “Other initiatives are intended to help customers adjust to the little changes they may have to make in daily living.

BEIJING (AFP) - Police in China's virus epicentre Wuhan acted \"inappropriately\" by punishing a doctor who blew the whistle on the outbreak that has now killed more than 9,000 worldwide, a Chinese government investigation found on Thursday (March 19). \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of a group of doctors in Wuhan who shared posts on social media warning of a Sars-like virus spreading in the city in December, was reprimanded by police for sharing the information and made to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more \"law-breaking actions\". \n His death from the virus in February prompted a national outpouring of grief as well as anger at the government's handling of the crisis, and bold demands for freedom of speech. \n A central government investigation initiated after Dr Li's death found that Wuhan police \"acted inappropriately by issuing a disciplinary letter\" and took \"irregular law enforcement procedures,\" state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday. \n The investigators also found that Dr Li's colleagues had repeatedly attempted to resuscitate the 34-year-old before he was declared dead because he was \"very young\", CCTV said. \n State media said his colleagues told investigators, \"as long as there was a bit of hope, we were unwilling to give up, at the time there were no other factors\". \n The central government investigators \"suggest\" that Wuhan authorities \"supervise and rectify the matter\", and urged local police to revoke the disciplinary statement issued to Dr Li, according to CCTV. \n Beijing has sought to direct criticism over the mishandling of the virus outbreak onto provincial officials, with several of the region's top Communist Party and health officials sacked. \n Dr Li's death had initially been reported by state media before their reports were quickly deleted. Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed Dr Li's death only hours later, after saying he was undergoing emergency treatment. \n Social media users who immediately took to the Twitter-like Weibo platform in droves to mourn Dr Li - before posts related to his death were scrubbed by censors - had accused hospital authorities of inappropriately attempting to resuscitate him after he had already died. \n China reported zero domestic Covid-19 infections for the first time on Thursday, even as nations across the world shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic. \n China's central government has sought to distance itself from the origins of the disease, initially by sacking local officials blamed for allowing the virus to spread, and recently by supporting the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 originated in the United States.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Goa govt to form special task force.

Even if not under quarantine, many are too worried to venture for long outside or to visit a hospital for other ailments as they fear they might catch the highly contagious virus.\nThe surge of inquiries has also been driven by healthcare platforms offering some services for free amid the epidemic.\nJD Health, an arm of JD.com Inc (JD.O), has seen its daily volume of respiratory-related online consultations jump by nine times while mental-health consultations have grown five to seven times, according to Xiao Jianbo, the company's general manager of online healthcare.\n\"Most of the requests I've had between the end of January and mid-February were about the coronavirus,\" said Liu Yafeng, a doctor who works fulltime for JD Health. \"People are so worried even just by a sneeze.\"\nSuch is the state of fretfulness that \"Always thinking I've been infected by the virus\" has become a trending topic with more than 570 million views on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging platform.\nLiu said he worked around 12 hours per day from end January to mid-February, but in a positive sign that panic about the epidemic is receding, he is now working eight hours a day.\nBaidu Inc (BIDU.O) said its online doctor consultation platform Wenyisheng, which translates to \"Ask Doctor\", has been handling around 850,000 free inquiries daily.

The undetected cases were \"largely\" responsible for the rapid spread of covid-19 in China. Many of these people would not have very serious symptoms of the disease. These are the main conclusions of a study published this Monday in scientific journal Science.\nTo achieve these results, scientists used a computational model based on data from infections reported in China and mobility between 10-January (the day it was announced that there was a new coronavirus infecting humans) and February 8 in China.\nThree major results have been achieved with this. First, it was observed that 86% of all infections caused by the new coronavirus were not reported prior to the blockade of January 23 in Wuhan, the Chinese city that started as the epicenter of the epidemic. Then it was found that per person the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% for documented infections. And the undetected cases were even the source of the 79% infection of the detected cases.\nFinally, it is emphasised that the Chinese Government's drastic measures and people's understanding have reduced the rate of spread of the virus in China. After all, after travel restrictions and restrictions were imposed, the transmission of the outbreak in China slowed down.\n\"The explosion of cases of the covid-19 in China was largely driven by people with mild or even no symptoms that had not been detected\", says Jeffrey Shaman, researcher at the University of Columbia's Mailman Public Health School (United States) and one of the authors of the study. \"Unsigned cases can expose a much larger share of the population to the virus. We notice that these cases are numerous and contagious in China.\" The authors also warn that these \"stealthy transmissions\" will continue to be a major challenge to contain the pandemic from now on.\n"}, {"content": "After 2-month long battle, normalcy returns to China's coronavirus epicentre Wuhan.

Families were confined to their homes. Bus and taxi services were shut, and only essential stores were allowed to remain open.\nI think the resumption of work represents a kind of hope. It at least shows that China is victorious, said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.\nChina’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. Mainland China now has 81,394 cases, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.\nWuhan accounts for about 60% of China’s coronavirus cases, but they have fallen sharply in recent weeks, a sign that the measures are working. The last confirmed locally transmitted case of the virus in Wuhan was on Monday.\nWith the United States, Italy and Spain and other countries now battling soaring infections, China is focussing on the risk posed by imported cases - most of them Chinese returning home.\nEffective Saturday, China suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.\nDISINFECTANT AND MASKS\nBut even with the decline in cases and loosening of restrictions, Wuhan authorities were taking few chances.\nStaff, some in full-body protective gear, and volunteers bustled around the railway station in the morning, setting out hand disinfectant and putting up signs reminding travellers they need a mobile-phone-based health code to take public transport.\nA worker walked through one metro train carrying a signboard reading: Wear a mask for the entire journey, people should not gather and when you disembark please scan the health code.\nEveryone is taking the right precautions. So, there shouldn’t be a problem, Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. But you have to be careful.\nThe existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.\nLife in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain.

SINGAPORE — Ms Sheryl Teo, 26, and her fiance Mr Bryan Cheong, 28, are not letting the Covid-19 outbreak stand in the way of a Valentine’s Day tradition they have maintained for four years. \n Ms Teo, who works in corporate communications, and Mr Cheong, a digital marketing executive, will be heading down to Tanjong Beach Club in Sentosa on Friday (Feb 14) night just as they initially planned. \n “Ever since our first Valentine’s Day together four years ago, we’ve been going to Sentosa beach for dinner and drinks to celebrate, and we planned to keep this tradition,” said Ms Teo. \n When they heard that Singapore’s first confirmed Covid-19 case was related to Sentosa, the pair discussed breaking this tradition to stay home and watch Netflix, but chose to wait and see before making a decision. A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore’s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n “Our mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,” Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: “Most Singaporeans my age that I know aren’t really bothered by the outbreak. We don’t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.” \n Ms Teo added: “I guess going ahead with our Valentine’s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.” \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine’s Day, the couple will spend this year’s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n “We have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,” said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine’s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine’s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together, but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: “I feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.” \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: “Life still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there’s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.” \n “Also, it’s our first Valentine’s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?” \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine’s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because\nthey felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine’s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n “When I’m on night shift, I don’t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,” she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n “It feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she’s back. She’s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she’s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,” he said. \n “I think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,” he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine’s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine’s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n “I’m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won’t have any changes in our plan,” said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: “We usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another. We are not so concerned about the flowers and champagne.” \n “We believe that a relationship isn’t just about Valentine’s Day. If you make time for each other, every day can be Valentine’s Day,” she added. \n Mr Chua said: “Naturally I am very worried about the outbreak. But I guess ultimately if we stick to the basic rules for personal hygiene, there will be many couples who can just have their usual Valentine’s Day programme.” \n “At the end of the day, there’s never a 100 per cent guarantee that you will be safe, and you can only worry so much. I guess you just have to strike a balance.” \n  \n"}, {"content": "Covid-19! Spanish PM calls for political unity to combat pandemic.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tightened up its travel instructions for China and now recommends Australians not to travel to China.\nMorrison announced that the ban would be enforced by the border authorities immediately. Passengers exempted from the ban should return to the country in a two-week \"self-quarantine\", he said. Morisson follows the example of the US government, which had already imposed a similar entry ban a day before.

Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory.

The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals.

The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it.

The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAustralia reported the first three cases of corona virus last Saturday, and the number of infected in the country is now nine.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and  led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humou\nr or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay.

Postponed premieres, hundreds of closed theaters all over the world, almost ghost rooms, cancelled footage. The impact of SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as the new coronavirus, on the film industry is leading to immediate shortages in box office results and estimates of losses that may rise to the four,5 billion euro worldwide, but above all with the focus on Asia.\nThe accounts are of analysts quoted by the Hollywood Reporter magazine, who estimate that losses may rise or even exceed, and that the largest world exhibition market, the US, is also the victim of a drop in turnout, the 4,5 billion euro. The main damage is mainly related to the screening of cinema in the countries most affected by the coronavirus, and which in some cases are even the most important markets in the world. There is no time limit for regularising the situation with regard to decisions by companies and authorities, nor for the confidence of some spectators to return.\nThe countries most affected by the sharp decrease in the number of spectators are China (the world's second largest market), South Korea (the world's fifth largest market), Italy or Japan (the world's third largest market). In addition, in the world of entertainment, there are postponed concert tours of musicians to Asian portions or promotional or press events that take place in Skype sessions or web conferences, the closing of cinemas, The escape of spectators and the cancellation of premieres in important Chinese or South Korean markets are having a direct impact on cinema.\nIn China there are 70 thousand closed cinemas with no prospect of reopening for the coming months. A gigantic drop in box office results is palpable in the numbers: Variety magazine cites data from the film market analyst Comscore that show how in the first two months of 2020 the Chinese box office made only 214 million euros (gross results) against the 1,8 billion euros it had embedded in 2019. Only in the last month, that of the Chinese New Year and the one in which the Covid-19 outbreak became known, the revenue went from 1,5 billion euros in 2019 to mere 4,2 million euros this year.\nIn South Korea the loss is 70% compared to last year. \"Cinemas are open, but they might as well not be,\" says a distributor anonymously to the Hollywood Reporter. \"The situation is much worse than what we saw during the MERS outbreak in 2015 [the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV]. At the time there was a public outage of more than 40% but there were no closed cinemas and the market rose last month\", says the responsible for the South Korean Film Commission. Viewers tend to avoid rooms at a time when there are more than 4800 cases in the country, where for example the premiere of a black-and-white version of Parasites, the South Korean film that historically snatched the Oscars this year, has been postponed.\nIn Japan (980 cases confirmed this Tuesday), there is estimated to be a 10 to 15% drop in the box office. Already in Italy, the biggest European focus of the new disease, only last weekend did the influx to Italian theaters fall 75% in relation to the same weekend as 2019, for example. This week, in Italy there are about 850 screens not working, the total in the country is 1830, recalls Variety. The premieres of some American films have been postponed.\nAlso in China, the US film premieres for the coming weeks and months are suspended: Mulan premieres, 007: No Time to Die, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic the Movie have been postponed; In South Korea, the premiere of Bora A, Pixar, is also dated. The postponement of simultaneous global premieres, notably by failing the important Chinese market, increases the risk of piracy and additional loss of revenue.\nLooking to the future is a tough thing to do right now. In the Chinese capital, for example, we must comply with the directives of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Municipal Cinema Office, which, since 26 in February, have forced the authorities to approve in advance the start of cinemas. To reopen, tickets must only be sold in alternating queues and only to spectators who identify themselves. Each room must be thoroughly disinfected immediately after one session and before the next.\nAs for filming, remind Variety, if the teams are inferred\nFifty people are almost automatically allowed to shoot in Beijing as long as the body temperature of the workers does not exceed the 37 degrees centigrade and everyone (except actors) wears masks. The larger teams are even forbidden to work. \"Looking at the current situation, the film industry is not equipped to resume work\", admits Chen Bei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing municipal government. Among the outstanding films is Jia Zhang-ke's next project, as the director told the IndieWire website, whose shooting is postponed sine die.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn this field, and among the first professional victims of the coronavirus impact are the filming of the next Mission: Impossible in Venice, suspended until further notice.\nIndustry also resents the purely negotiating side. The presence of Chinese buyers on audiovisual markets such as MIPTV this spring, as with the low accession of Chinese distributors at the last Berlin Film Festival, should be sparse and important distribution agreements may therefore be lost. With cancellations or postponements of events and fairs around the world, from the Bologna Children's Book Fair to the Paris Book Salon, the Hollywood Reporter indicates that the Cannes Festival is still on the table and that preparations for the biggest international film event continue, albeit attentive to the \"developments and directives by the authorities.\"\n"}, {"content": "UN, UNSC yet to hold formal discussions on Covid-19 even as global death toll crosses 21,000.

PITTSBURG, Pennsylvania: Snakes – the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra – may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter. \n The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States. \n Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. \n It’s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV. But there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat. \n THE DEADLY WUHAN CORONAVIRUS \n The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope. \n Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. \n Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS and MERS can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans. \n  \n This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS and MERS. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. \n Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. \n A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease. \n THE PROBLEM WITH ZOONOTIC TRANSMISSIONS \n Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. \n This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. \n Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. \n Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS and MERS is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. \n In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalised were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. \n  \n However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market. \n The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses. \n The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. \n The authors further found that the RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the “crown” of the virus particle that recognises the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people. \n But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes. \n FROM BATS TO SNAKES \n The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hed\ngehogs, manis, bats and humans. \n Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes. \n Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. \n Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species – bats – to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. \n However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery. \n The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. \n  \n However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus’ source animal. \n Sampling RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols. \n The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Haitao Guo is Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

What can the individual do in view of the outbreak of the new Coronavirus? How do we arm ourselves in case the lung infection from China also becomes an epidemic in Europe? The head of the UK Wellcome Trust, the world's second largest medical research foundation, tweeted a few days ago:'One thing that would help is to get flu shots.'\nAt first, it seems strange. Because a flu shot does not protect against an infection with the virus called 2019-nCoV, which has spread from the city of Wuhan since the turn of the year in China and across national borders. In some cases it has already been smuggled into Europe. In Germany, too, a person has become infected with the pathogen.\nThe idea behind Jeremy Farrar's call for flu vaccination was another: Because the symptoms of a real flu (see box) and the lung disease caused by the corona virus may be similar at first, flu patients would quickly become suspected cases of corona in case of doubt. With all the consequences that would have. They would also have to be isolated and tested for the pathogen that infected them. Last but not least, those affected would be put into fear and terror. In this respect, flu-prevention vaccinations could alleviate the pressure on the health system that the new pathogen could bring about should it also lead to an epidemic in us. In short, the milder the flu season, the fewer additional problems pests would have.\nThe flu caused by the flu virus usually starts suddenly with fever, dry irritation, muscle and/or headache. Other symptoms may include general weakness, sweating, but also nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea. The duration of the illness is usually five to seven days.\nThe current flu situation in Germany can be seen on the website of the Working Group Influenza.\nBy far, not all flu-infected people are so typical. Depending on the severity of the flu season, several hundred to more than 20.000 people die each year from a flu (source: Robert Koch Institute)\nInfection is mainly caused by droplets such as coughing or sneezing. They reach the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract of healthy people over a short distance. In addition, transmission is also possible over hands and surfaces contaminated by virus-containing secretions.\nThe Standing Vaccine Commission (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends the prevention of influenza for all persons from 60 years, all pregnant women, persons with increased health risk (e.g. persons with chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular or circulatory diseases, liver or kidney diseases, diabetes or other metabolic diseases, multiple sclerosis, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency) and for residents of nursing homes.\nIn addition, persons at increased risk (e.g. medical personnel) and persons at risk of infecting their carers should be vaccinated, as should persons with direct contact with poultry and wild birds. (Although vaccination does not protect against avian influenza, it avoids problematic double infections).\nSimilarly, the Robert Koch Institut e (RKI), even though its President Lothar Wieler recommended vaccination against influenza, restricted a press conference with Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) on Tuesday to special risk groups. his institute recommends a flu shot anyway, should they now please also take it, he said.\nThis means people from sixty years old, pregnant, chronically ill, and also employees, residents of old or nursing homes, as well as people with a high risk of becoming infected with influenza, such as medical personnel or people in institutions with a high level of public transport. Yeah.\nThe RKI receives support from politicians. \"Flu vaccination always makes sense, and this is only right now,\" said EU vice-president responsible for health policy Georg Nutlein (CSU) in a conversation with ZEIT ONLINE.\nIf recommendations were to be extended to all citizens, the experts would have to decide for themselves.\n\"We have no cause for coercion or intervention of any kind at the moment. There is no cause for panic,\" stressed Knesslein. In particular, however, domestic physicians should now focus more on the protection of flu. \"This also serves the safety and well-being of the people,\" said Knesslein.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nSimilarly, his SPD colleague, from the Group of the European People's Party, Barbel Bas. \"A flu vaccination is useful. In my view, more people should get vaccinated,\" she said TIME ONLINE. A reason to extend the influenza vaccination recommendation, the politician sees everything\nIt's not. The effort to test a person suspected of having a coronavirus infection is understandable: \"If symptoms of an infection with the Coronavirus are present and the person concerned has been in a risk area in China in the last 14 days or has had contact with a sick person, then this person will be tested for the Coronavirus in accordance with hygienic measures such as mouth-nose protection,\" Bas said.\nThe test could also be carried out by people who were in the Chinese province of Hubei, from whose capital Wuhan had spread further in January, or had contact with a proven infected person, including if they had no symptoms yet.\nIn general, according to doctors, the best time to get vaccinated is October or November, that is, before the flu season begins. But even now, vaccination may still be useful, stressed RKI President Wieler. The time after the change of year is generally considered as the one in which especially many flu infections occur. However, it will take ten to 14 days for the vaccine to take effect.\nOf course, vaccines can also be given to people who do not belong to the risk groups. Many health insurance funds, including the three largest, namely the Technical Health Fund (TK), the German Employees Health Fund (DAK) and the Barmer Replacement Fund (BEK), cover the costs for all insured persons who so wish.\nIn healthy young people, vaccination reduces the risk of influenza by 80 percent, in elderly people who are particularly recommended for vaccination due to the statistically higher mortality risk due to the infection, it is still 41 to 63 percent. According to researchers at the RKI, despite moderate vaccination rates, you are still The vaccine prevents flu disease every year in excess of 60-year-olds. Depending on the severity of the flu season and the type of pathogen that changes every year, which is why the vaccine must be constantly developed and re-administered annually, between a few hundred and more people die in this country. s 20.000 people a year on a flu. 2017/18 it was even 25.100.\nFor those who want to protect themselves and others from an infection, RKI Vice-President Lars has some practical tips: sneeze in the elbows, often wash your hands, keep your distance from people who are cold. \"This protects against influenza and also applies, we should get more cases of the new Coronavirus in Germany.\"\nRead more about the new Coronavirus here.\n"}, {"content": "Yen holds gains on virus woes, euro crumbles on weak growth outlook.

Train emergency department staff to provide rapid diagnostic tools for coronavirus patients who may be hospitalized in Wuhan. This is how large Spanish hospitals deal with the epidemic sweeping China and arriving in nine other countries by international flights. This is not the case in Spain at present: the Ministry of Health reported on Friday that two suspected cases under study, namely patients with respiratory diseases recently arrived from Wuhan, were tested negative. But late at night, Basque countries reported that one of their patients had some suspicious symptoms and was being monitored. She recently visited Wuhan.\n\"We are following all this with great interest, but also very calmly. This new virus is unlikely to become a related problem in Spain,\" said Santiago Moreno, director of infectious disease services at Ramon and Cahar hospitals in Madrid. This position is consistent with that of the Department. \"People must have a very low awareness of risks,\" Fernando Simon, director of the health alert and emergency coordination center, said when introducing the measures agreed by the health and autonomous region.\nThe three views are most frequently repeated by the experts consulted by the magazine. First, we know little about viruses. \"We don't know the infection rate. It tells us how many people are infected in each case. We also don't know whether there are asymptomatic or very mild cases,\" explained Jesus Rodr í Guez bath, director of infectious diseases department of virgin Macarena hospital (Seville).\nSecond, according to the available data, the coronavirus in Wuhan seems to be less toxic than other coronaviruses that have caused the epidemic since 2002. Juan Carlos gal á n, spokesman of the Spanish Society for infectious diseases and Microbiology (seimc), said: \"the mortality rate is less than 5%, while SARS and mers are 10% and 35% higher respectively.\" In addition, Magda Campins, director of preventive medicine at Vall d'Hebron hospital in Barcelona, added: \"although human to human transmission has been proved, it does not seem to be lower than SARS.\".\nAs a third important idea, the experts concluded that before the investigation made progress and international institutions made more accurate recommendations, it was best to \"take the necessary measures here and be prepared in any case,\" Jose Miguel sisneros said, Head of infectious diseases, virgin del rocho hospital. \"Don't worry, because our public health system and hospitals are well prepared to deal with such an event,\" he added.\nCampins said that the first step taken by the hospital is to \"make an agreement for emergency room staff, which is the gate of the hospital\". \"The aim is to determine whether the patient has symptoms compatible with the virus and whether he has recently been to Wuhan,\" he added. Rodr í Guez bath said that if the two facts coincide, \"patients must be hospitalized alone, and medical staff should take routine preventive measures until the disease is ruled out or confirmed to be caused by the virus.\". He added that these measures include \"hand protection and respiratory barriers, such as high protective masks, to spread in air defense.\".\nThe instructions finalized by the Ministry of health and the autonomous region stipulate that samples of all suspected patients should be submitted to the National Microbiology Center (CNM), which will serve as a reference and obtain the results within about one day. But big hospitals have a technology called PCR, which can improve the level of diagnosis in a few hours. \"We are buying a specific kit to identify the gene of Wuhan virus by PCR,\" Campins said. \"We have ordered the goods and they will arrive on Monday,\" Ramon and Cahar explained.\nFernando Simon explained on Friday that if any positive cases are detected, contacts will be monitored, even if the virus \"is not too infectious\". For example, during a flight, he would track the evolution of the two passengers in his seat\nDo. Its purpose is to enable the public network to sensitively detect cases without blocking the medical system. At present, the Ministry of health does not intend to take special measures at the airport because there are no direct flights in Wuhan. Simon said that this is a measure \"not proved to be useful\". He explained that passengers from long-distance flights often have respiratory symptoms, especially in winter, so the inspection of arrivals \"will not bring enough benefits\".\nThe Ministry of Health concluded that the virus \"is unlikely to reach Spain, but it may occur\". \"That's why we're ready to take action,\" Simon explained. He recalled that among these outbreaks, the most important thing is to take action from the source. He believes that China's quarter has reduced the risk.\n"}, {"content": "chinese president xi jinping, under fire, says he led covid-19 fight early on. BEIJING — Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China’s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it — and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China’s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had “issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control” the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n “I have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,” Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi’s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n “The overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,” said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “He wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.” \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn’t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government’s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China’s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern — making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n “It seems like he’s trying to indicate that ‘We weren’t asleep at the wheel,’” said Dr Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “But it comes off like, ‘We knew this was a problem, but we weren’t sounding the alarm.’” \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their “shortcomings” in implementing the party’s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n “For now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,” Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. “This shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.” \n The new information places Mr Xi’s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi’s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city’s People’s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission’s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But\nsigns were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died — the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year — making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia’s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China’s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi’s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the “front line” of China’s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n “What’s really interesting in the speech is, there’s a lot of the word ‘I’ in it,” said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “This is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing’s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China’s political system.” \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES\n"}, {"content": "Breakingviews - Breakdown: Coronavirus goes global. NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s not time to panic, but it is time to face reality. The coronavirus is spreading around the world. China’s unprecedented efforts slowed the spread of the new disease officially known as Covid-19, but that’s merely won some time. Infected people have now been detected on every continent except Antarctica. Competent and open government is the best defense against hospitals and society being overwhelmed. But nations will probably have to deal with recurring outbreaks.\nNo. China helped reduce transmission by shutting down public gatherings, factories, and schools. Mass testing is also key to figure out who has the disease, and track who may have been exposed. China now claims the number of new cases is falling. While the country’s official statistics are notoriously unreliable, it makes sense such methods would slow the spread of the disease which has afflicted more than 78,000 people in the People’s Republic and killed around 2,700.\nWhile the World Health Organization has declined to call it a pandemic – a deadly disease which is spreading worldwide – the cat is out of the bag. Cases have been found in 50 countries, and the list is rapidly growing. On Wednesday the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded those inside the country for the first time since the disease was identified in early December.\nWhat’s especially alarming is that one of the first indications of a mass outbreak in Iran came from a traveler being diagnosed in Canada. If countries that appear uninfected are spreading the disease, many other outbreaks are presumably underway. Nearly every country neighboring Iran has now been affected.\nFor a disease to be truly worrisome, it needs to be both highly contagious and dangerous. Ebola has caused a lot of suffering in central Africa, but the disease often kills its victims before they can infect many others. The odds of it spreading widely are therefore low.\nBy comparison the 2009 flu – the last pandemic – spread all over the earth but was surprisingly mild. America’s Centers for Disease Control estimates over 60 million Americans were stricken. It swamped medical offices, workplaces were short-staffed, and schools emptied. But it only killed about one out of every 5,000 people who were infected.\nThe new coronavirus appears to spread easily. The experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests it can be explosive. Out of 3,700 passengers and crew, there have been about 700 confirmed cases and that number continues to rise. More broadly, cases outside China are more than doubling every week. It’s also dangerous. The estimated death rate for Covid-19 is about 2%, making it about 20 times deadlier than typical influenza.\nHealthcare systems aren’t designed to deal with pandemics, because they are so unusual. The United States has about 900,000 hospital beds, about two-thirds of which are occupied on average according to the CDC. The World Health Organization estimates about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, with others serious or critical. So if just 1% of America’s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn’t be enough hospital beds. An uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units.\nHospitals would probably run short of protective gear. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said the government has stockpiled 30 million masks, but it needs 300 million to protect front-line healthcare workers alone. Doctors would be overloaded, because many would become sick, and because people who have not been infected would still seek help.\nStretched medical systems will kill more patients. This dynamic helps explain why the death rate in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, has been higher than in other parts of China. Countries with poor medical care will be hit harder. They lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen the outbreak, while patients won’t be treated.\nClosed factories and housebound consumers have already depressed Chinese economic activity. Companies ranging from Apple to Yum China have warned of supply chain issues and decreased demand. These will cascade as more countries embrace drastic measures. Japan on Thursday closed all its schools early ahead of an upcoming spring break.\nIt’s notable that three of the four flu pandemics in the past century were followed shortly by U.S. recessions. The\nexception was the 2009 outbreak, which occurred when the world economy was already in the dumps. Closed factories and offices reduce output, restaurants and cinemas suffer revenue shortfalls, corporate debt weighs heavier, while small businesses may fail if the owner falls sick or dies.\nThe World Bank estimated in 2014 that a pandemic of similar size and effect to the 1918 flu would knock 5% off global gross domestic product. That disease was both widespread and probably more virulent – it killed over 50 million people – so that’s a worst-case scenario.\nAllowing information to flow freely is the best way to identify clusters early. When local officials cover up, or doctors are afraid to disclose cases, outbreaks fester. The epidemics in China and Iran probably would have been caught and acted upon earlier in less authoritarian countries.\nMeasures such as shutting down society or closing borders can slow transmission, but can’t be sustained for months on end. Democratic societies may not allow the kind of intensive surveillance China has practiced. Workers and businesses can only go so long before the financial crunch becomes unbearable. China is now revving back up, and that will almost certainly result in more infections.\nMass testing of the exposed and isolating the sick can be sustained and might keep clusters manageable. But this requires a functioning system with competent leadership. South Korea said on Wednesday that over 20,000 people were being tested. The United States has not started surveillance and has only been testing about a dozen people a day. That means undetected outbreaks are probably underway.\nPast pandemics have spread in waves. The virus may propagate more effectively when the weather is cold and dry. Behavior changes too; people wash their hands more often when evidence of sickness is around them. As the proportion of the population with immunity rises, the disease spreads more slowly. However, immunity may wane over time. The most likely outcome is that the disease becomes endemic with smaller outbreaks following the initial flare.\nSeveral anti-viral medicines and vaccines are already being tested. Showing efficacy, safety and scaling up production will take time, though. A drug to treat the coronavirus probably won’t be widely available for at least a year; developing a vaccine will take longer. In the meantime, the world can only prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best.\n"}, {"content": "hundreds of americans flown home from cruise ship, 14 with coronavirus. SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China's economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody's on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the \"best decision ever\".  \n \"US Gov't said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,\" he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" a statement from the company's Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n \"We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\" said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \"We have no idea when we get to get home.\"  \n  \n CHI\nNA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.  \n Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.  \n Japan's Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo.

With many questions still unanswered, the main concern of the various countries is to try to stop the transmission of the virus and find a possible cure or specific treatment.\nGhebreyesus said it would be a \"big, big mistake\" to abandon the mitigation strategy for the new coronavirus, adding that each country must \"aggressively restrain\". The WHO Director-General also said that more than twenty vaccines are being developed and that some clinical trials are already being conducted. They expect results in the next few weeks.\n23 million extra budget\nGermany has been adding up since the beginning of crisis 48 cases (until this Friday), from which 18 are already recovering. There was no record of death until this afternoon. The German Ministry of Health has permanently updated information on its website. A special budget has been set up to deal with the outbreak: 23 million euro for measures to prevent, communicate and repatriate citizens, among others. In Germany, Robert Koch Institute should avoid, regardless of symptoms, unnecessary contact with other people and should \"stay at home whenever possible\". If they develop symptoms, they should go to the doctor and warn him first by telephone, providing information about the countries visited, the ministry continues. These are considered areas of risk: China, South Korea, Iran and Italy.\nPassengers coming from China, Hong Kong and Macao still have to fill out a document with information on where they will be staying for the next thirty days in Germany, giving their contacts so that cases can be found among those who travelled together. They also have to report where exactly they were in China. All information about travellers must be made available by the airlines to the German health authorities. Airplane pilots are instructed to report the state of health of passengers before they land; some suspect case must be reported to the airport before they can land. a doctor who must get on the plane, examine the traveller concerned and decide what to do. The same rules must apply to trains and buses crossing land borders.\nGermany will \"continue to try to isolate people as much as possible by treating them in clinics and providing care for possible contact persons.\" This week the Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, said. Precautionary measures have already been taken, such as the closure of schools and nurseries in a city, Heinsberg, in North Rhine-Westphalia, whose authorities have ordered domestic quarantine for all persons (between 300 and 400, according to the different media) who participated in a Carnival event this month. These people may be asked for blood samples. This after it has been confirmed that a couple who was at that party is infected. Other cases, 14 in total, confirmed on Thursday in Heinsberg, do not need hospitalization but remain isolated in their homes.\nPeople without symptoms should lead a \"normal life\"\nThe Spanish Government recommends normal life for all people, even those returned from risk zones.

The same applies to what arrived in the last days of Iran and certain areas of South Korea. Avoid contact with other people and telephone the lines of the National Health Service are the recommendations. But measures such as closing borders are now far removed. \"If you look at Italy, they have stopped all flights from China and are now the most affected country in Europe,\" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock this week.\nIf you have symptoms, you should stay at home alone until you have your test results.

GENEVA (Reuters) - There may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China.\nIn all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.\n“From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.\nThe WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. “It is still early days, we don’t have a clear clinical picture.”\nSome types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others - like the one that causes MERS - are far more severe.\nThe U.N. agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be “re-purposed”, Van Kerkhove said.\nWith Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many  Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert.\nRichard Brow, the agency’s representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: World Bank calls on all countries to reinforce health surveillance.

As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Cov\nid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.\n"}, {"content": "novel coronavirus outbreak raises spectre of sars. Many have drawn parallels between the current novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2002 and 2003. \n It would be difficult not to. \n Both outbreaks are caused by novel animal coronaviruses that ended up infecting humans. Both originated in China, can cause severe human disease and have resulted in deaths. Both have been declared “public health emergencies of international concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n But there are significant differences between the two outbreaks and let’s guard against seeing the 2019-nCoV from an old lens. \n First, let’s consider why Sars is deeply entrenched in many Singaporeans’ psyche. \n The Sars outbreak was a seminal event for Singapore and its healthcare system in particular. While the 238 cases and 33 deaths here between March and July 2003 may seem small when compared to most other serious medical conditions, Sars caused considerable fear and uncertainty among the people, with outsized economic and public health impact. \n These include the ramifications from the closure of Tan Tock Seng Hospital — a large general hospital — to non-Sars patients for almost three months. \n Then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described the Sars epidemic as a “defining moment” for Singapore. \n While WHO had praised Singapore for its exemplary handling of the epidemic, the outbreak also highlighted how unprepared our country was for a novel respiratory virus outbreak. \n In its aftermath, fundamental changes to hospitals and outbreak management in our country were made that have been extensively described elsewhere. \n As a result, Singapore is now far more prepared for 2019-nCoV and other epidemics compared to 2003. \n The collective psychological impact and institutional memory of Sars has meant that we have a tendency to view each new epidemic through the lens of the Sars experience. \n When the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared on the horizon in April 2009, the initial planning in Singapore that I could observe revolved around containing the disease — early detection of infected persons for hospitalisation and prolonged isolation, as well as quarantining their contacts. \n This was triggered when the first patient in Singapore was diagnosed in May 2009. \n However, the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus — like all influenza viruses — is a markedly different beast compared to the Sars coronavirus (Sars-CoV). \n It spreads far more easily in the community, and poses a far lower risk of death. \n Fewer than one per thousand will die after being infected by influenza compared to slightly more than one in 10 persons infected with Sars. \n What this means is that pandemic influenza could never have been contained in Singapore, but the consequences of failing was not dire. \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) stepped down control measures for the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus over a short few months and changed its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert level to green (normal) in February 2010, by which time an estimated several hundred thousand had been infected by flu. \n Doctors and public health professionals also believe the influence A (H1N1)pdm09 virus caused more deaths than Sars. \n Did the initial measures slow down the spread of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in Singapore sufficiently so that the healthcare system was not overwhelmed and people had time to be socialised to the idea that the pandemic was not worse than the usual seasonal flu? \n We do not know the answers to these questions. \n Fast forward to today, and it is clear now that there are crucial differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan as well. \n During its approximate nine-month course, Sars infected 8,096 persons — 5,327 in mainland China — and resulted in 774 deaths. \n A significant proportion of its spread occurred in hospitals (40.8 per cent in Singapore). Within a third of that time, the 2019-nCoV has infected as of Feb 3 over 16,000 persons — more than 98 per cent of whom are in China — and resulted in over 300 deaths. \n Almost the entirety of its spread has been in the community. Part of the heightened case count is due to timing. \n The Wuhan outbreak occurred just before Chinese New Year, a period where the largest human migration on earth occurs. \n The world is also far more connected today than in 2003. However, it is also apparent now that the n\novel coronavirus is more infectious than the Sars-CoV, with several family or travel clusters among those diagnosed overseas. \n Asymptomatic infections have been reported, which did not happen with Sars-CoV, with Germany reporting a plausible case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n The silver lining is that the 2019-nCoV appears far less deadly compared to the Sars-CoV. \n The case fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV is currently estimated to be around 2 per cent (i.e. 2 out of every 100 infected will die), although the actual figure might be lower depending on the number of persons with mild disease who did not present to a healthcare facility and were thus undiagnosed. \n So currently the 2019-nCoV is shaping up to look less like Sars-CoV, and more like a virulent form of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, although more data is required before we can be completely certain. \n One important lesson is that the initial information obtained at the start of epidemics is incomplete and can be misleading. \n In early January 2020, there was little to suggest that the 2019-nCoV was different from the Sars and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses in terms of how it spreads and the severity of infection. \n Similarly, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus was initially believed to be as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918, which was estimated to have wiped out between 3 and 5 per cent of the human population. \n Within a few short weeks, however, sufficient information became available for a more concrete re-assessment in both 2009 and 2020. \n We do not know at present whether the 2019-nCoV epidemic can be contained. \n China has instituted incredible control measures — in effect virtually quarantining an entire province — that would be unthinkable anywhere else in the world. \n However, the virus has already spread to more than 25 countries worldwide, including several that will not be able to mount as robust a response as China and other high-income countries should community spread occur. \n It is likely that the threat of 2019-nCoV will be present far longer than the nine months of Sars, while an effective vaccine will take far longer than a year to become commercially available. \n It is useful to look at the 2019-nCoV outbreak not through the lens of Sars, but entirely on its own characteristics and calibrate measures and policies towards minimising impact and living life as normally as possible during this period. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR:   \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.\n"}, {"content": "budget 2020: s$5.6 billion special packages to support firms, workers and households amid covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.  \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.  \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n   \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current ran\nge of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump their armrests in support.  \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.”\n"}, {"content": "Malaysia's fourth-quarter GDP growth seen slowing to weakest in 3-1\\/2 years: Reuters poll. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s economic growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have slowed to its weakest since mid-2016 on weaker private consumption and external demand, a Reuters poll showed.\nThe median forecast from the poll of 13 economists was for growth of 4.2% in October-December compared with a year earlier, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2016. That will be down from 4.4% in the third quarter and 4.9% in April-June.\nIndividual forecasts ranged from 3.4% to 4.6%.\nEconomic growth in Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy over the fourth quarter was likely weighed down by weakness in industrial production and exports, and slowing retail sales, according to Gareth Leather, senior asia economist with economic research consultancy Capital Economics.\n“Overall, we are penciling in growth of 4.0% y/y, down from 4.4% in Q3,” Leather said in a research note on Friday.\nFactory output in December grew 1.3% from a year earlier, below expectations and slower than the 2.0% expansion from the previous month.

Malaysia has so far confirmed 18 cases of coronavirus infection.\n"}, {"content": "Brothers-in-arms. Going into the abyss of the right-wing to extreme-right US media landscape these days, it seems that their propagandists have been waiting for an event such as the Corona pandemic. Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire and Podcaster website, warned a few days ago in his show that in the future \"every four or five years\" a virus will break out in China and therefore it would not be racist for Donald Trump to call the Coronavirus \"the Chinese virus\". A week ago, ultra-conservative radio editor Rush Limbaugh said in his broadcast:'Nothing beats the destruction of the entire US economy by a bio-threat from China, right?'\nAnd then there's Stephen Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist and former chief of the White Supremacy platform Breitbart. In his podcast War Room, which Bannon has been running since October last year, almost everything has been about Corona since the end of January, Bannon has established its own format, the title of which sounds like Action Game, War Room: Pandemic. When the epidemic began in the Chinese province of Hubei, Bannon speculated with his guests that the virus was created in a secret bioweapon program in the province capital Wuhan (this conspiracy theory is long recognized and refuted as such). Then he claimed that the World Health Organization was bought by China. In another episode, Bannon, who has been fantasizing for years about an imminent war in the South China Sea, said that China's Communist Party works with the same methods as Hitler and Goebbels.\nBannon's conspiracy theories are grotesque. He may have evolved into a political outsider after his short game in the White House and thus close to power, a clown, in fact. But that does not change the fact that figures like him have a million-dollar audience in the US. Bannon has been invited several times in recent weeks on Trump's favorite network, Fox News. And if what New York Magazine reported in January is true, then his podcast will also be heard by White House employees. Two years after Trump threw the Bannon he later christened \"Sloppy Steve\" off his team, it almost seems as if the two of them are slowly getting closer again.\nDonald Trump is not only a broadcaster, he is more than any of his predecessors also a willing recipient of media messages. If you want to understand what Trump says when, and this is not a new insight at all, you really only have to do what Trump himself likes to do: watch Fox News. The largest news channel in the United States regularly raises issues that the President will address shortly thereafter; who, in turn, produces regular news (including a scarcely discernible amount of untruths) that quickly spreads Fox News. They both need each other. Both also need constant hostility in order to keep their own voters or spectators in the mood.\nAt first glance, it seems that this symbiotic relationship has continued as usual in the past few weeks of the emerging and now seemingly unbridled Corona crisis in the United States. Trump initially denied, synchronised with the on-air statements of most Fox News moderators, the dangers of the Coronavirus and accused the political opponent, the Democratic Party, once again of conspiring against him and the country. After the Mueller investigation, under the impeachment procedure, Corona should now be the next alleged hoax, the next fictional story to bring down the president and his alleged achievements.\nThroughout March, however, Trump's rhetoric changed again in line with that of his home network. The tone became temporarily more cautious, sometimes even presidential in the traditional sense. Until Donald Trump lost his patience a few days ago, he seems to be taking too long with this virus: After Easter, in the middle of April, the country had to be \"opened\" again, Trump demanded (and was offered the stage by Fox News). The President seems to want to see the initial restrictions that are now in force in large parts of the United States lifted. The economic engine is to be applied, from zero to hundreds, by cold start. Trump that\nThe state of the US stock index has explained the measure of its political action, it cannot need a recession. Not a few months before the presidential election.\nTrump is, as the last few weeks have confirmed impressively, primarily about one thing: his re-election in November. In short, it seemed as if he had at least lost the power of interpretation over this crisis, that his administration had allowed important weeks, indeed almost two months, to pass without developing a federal strategy of prevention against the spread of the Coronavirus, is obvious. The point now is to at least keep the spin on the crisis, to determine the story. Since Trump has positioned himself as a strong leader in the daily Corona press conferences in the White House, his popularity has increased again. Trump's approval ratings are up to 49 per cent, which are surprisingly high given his administration's manifestly poor crisis management.\nConsidering the past three months since the news of the Corona outbreak in the Chinese province of Wuhan, one thing in political-media America this time was different than usual. There was a high-quality Fox News anchor who crashed on the Corona issue much earlier than the others. In January, when his colleagues, the President and most of the competitors were still mainly engaged in the Impeachment process, Tucker Carlson sounded the alarm about Corona. Carlson sends to Prime Time every night at 20-o'clock and is one of the most influential mood makers in the country.\nWhat was even more remarkable was that Carlson had already found a culprit before the massive spread of Covid-19 infections in the US had even begun. Carlson blamed \"Chinese culture\" when Trump tweeted to Chinese President Xi Jinping thanking him for his treatment of the virus. In a way, Carlson was \"trumpeter than trump\", as Vanity Fair put it a few days ago: Carlson saw an opportunity in the virus, but a racist one. He thus laid the foundations for what has been increasingly seen in the US since then: the right instrumentalisation of the pandemic.\nThe fact that Trump, who spoke at the end of February about the number of infected in the US being close to zero, now sees his country in a \"war\" against the \"Chinese virus\" and sees itself as \"President in wartime\" is also obviously due to Tucker Carlson decided to make an extraordinary intervention in early March. After observing Trump's blatant denial of the mounting Corona crisis for weeks, the moderator travelled on the 7th. March to Florida to convince Trump there, in his private club Mar-a-Lago, himself of the seriousness of the situation. He felt a \"moral obligation,\" Carlson later said in an interview. It was said that the conversation between the two men lasted two hours. Apparently effective. A lot of what Trump's been doing since then follows Carlson's script.\nThis means finding a simple story for a complex situation. More than three million Americans have already lost their jobs over the past two weeks as a result of the actual freezing of the US economy, the country is moving towards a recession, hospitals in particularly affected major cities such as New York City and Seattle have long been overloaded. Trump is now trying to find answers as well as distractions. The direction is increasingly changing: protecting national borders even more severely; Emphasize even more strongly the alleged enemies of the country; even more strongly invoke American patriotism and exceptionalism; even more furiously praise the local economy, and at the same time warn against its demise.\nIn short, Trump will probably be even more Trump. And the right media will help him, especially Fox News.\nThe character Tucker Carlson is not only interesting to understand Trump's change of tactics. Carlson's daily program also shows how panic production works. In the monologues held by the 50-year-old at the beginning of each broadcast, he reliably condemns everything that is somehow left: in principle, consent to immigration, feminism, climate protection, political correctness, globalism, diversity. What distinguishes Carlson from the other Fox News anchors is his occasional call\nalso swear against Republicans. Carlson likes to stage himself as an outraged loudspeaker of the simple worker. But the supposed opposition to the establishment, like Trump, ultimately serves only to play off the chauvinistic part of white America against minorities and immigrants.\nAlready on the first show Carlson reported the Corona virus on 23rd. In January, he made it clear what message was to come to his viewers from now on. \"I know we have to pretend that all cultures and all behaviour are the same,\" Carlson said, but that is not the case. \"The mistreatment of animals, the eating of koalas and snakes and bats and dogs, which is apparently common in this town, Wuhan,\" he continued.\nWhat Tucker Carlson hammered into his millions of viewers on a daily basis over the next two months can be condensed to this story, which he told on his show on 6th. March summed up, one day before his trip to Florida: communist China first took control of the global pharmaceutical business, then released a virus into the world, and because liberal media and left activists in the US were more important anti-racism and identity policy than secure borders, Many people would have to die now. It is not climate change that is the most existential threat facing the US, but the alleged dependence on China. \"The people who told us that life in a limitless world has no disadvantages have lied,\" said the moderator. \"Trump was right about everything: trade, immigration, production, globalization.\" Carlson's message was unequivocal: The Corona crisis was a chance to finally implement Trump's slogan \"Make America great again\".\nThe message seems to have arrived. \"I think we have learned a lot. We have learned a lot. This crisis has made it clear how important it is to have strong borders and a robust production sector,\" Trump said at a press conference the other day. A few days earlier, his staff had sent an e-mail to Trump supporters saying that the US was \"attacked not only by an invisible virus, but also by the Chinese\". The fact that the number of attacks on Americans of Asian origin has increased sharply in recent weeks is a direct consequence of this propaganda. \"I've never felt this way in my 27-year-old life in this country,\" tweeted Jiayang Fan, a New Yorker author, in mid-March.\nOne thing you can't blame Trump for after more than three years in the White House is that he's hard to read. Sometimes he follows his impulses, sometimes he follows Fox News. He knows no shame, he does not care about contradictions in content. But the main thing is always to assert his power. In this respect, it is remarkably transparent.\nAs far as the Corona narrative is concerned, the President and the right-wing media seem to have clearly agreed. The narrative is war.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that this is not just rhetorical. I got 26. In March, The Nation Magazine announced that the Washington government would send additional 1.500 soldiers to the Mexican and Canadian borders. While cities like New York have been waiting for support from Washington for weeks, the government is arming the already over-militarized border.\n\"I am a president at war,\" Trump said at a press conference a few days ago. And he said, \"This is a war, a different kind of war than we've ever had.\"\n"}, {"content": "Chinese doctor who first found out about coronavirus was censored. Now, he's dead due to virus.

The picture that Beijing is showing of coronavirus infections is not reflecting reality, says the British Financial Times diary based on several interviews with doctors, nurses and hospital staff in Wuhan and Beijing. There are suspicions that not all new cases are being recorded, and there is one category that is being systematically left off the list of official cases: infected who have no symptoms.\nIn Hubei Province, where the city of Wuhan was the source of the pandemic, no more than one new case was reported per day for more than a week, which allowed the government to say that the crisis period ended and to decree a kind of return to normality: many people are already starting work again, Although under enormous security measures, compulsory distance in workstations and canteens, disinfections three times a day in the workplace, for example.\nAnd even small steps have already been reversed: if there was much talk of reopening cinemas (although a number of rooms represented only five% of the huge Chinese market in the low-central provinces and with old films), this Friday, ten days later, it was announced that cinemas closed them all again, without any reason being given. Few spectators have taken advantage of the reopening: many fear that the situation is not yet under control and do not want to expose themselves to risk.\nBeijing has meanwhile announced a suspension of the entry of foreigners, saying that new cases of covid-19 are imported. This Friday, the US and Italy surpassed China in numbers of infected, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nThe Financial Times interviewed several doctors and specialists in China- most spoke in anonymity- who say that the situation in Wuhan may be worse than the authorities are showing. Two nurses in the city spoke to the British diary, saying that there are \"hidden\" numbers, which despite meeting the criteria for confirmed cases, are not to be included in the accounts.\n\"Health officials say the hospital is doing everything to control the counting of new cases,\" said one of the nurses. \"It is extremely worrying to continue to advertise that there are no new cases. It is very risky, and it may mean that the sacrifices made in Wuhan and in the whole province of Hubei have been of no avail,\" he complained.\nIn addition, the authorities are counting the cases of infected people who have no symptoms but do not include them in confirmed cases, said a health expert living in Beijing. The government agency that makes the guidelines on what should be considered a confirmed case, says the Financial Times, says that asymptomatic cases should not appear in total confirmed cases.\nThis distinction may be problematic because even if we do not know how or in what percentage, people without symptoms continue to be able to transmit the virus to others. And the local newspaper Caixin quoted experts saying that in Wuhan they were detected every day, \"some, or a few dozen, of asymptomatic carriers\", which means that it is not possible to \"conclude that the transmission has stopped in Wuhan\".\nThe Government maintains that these cases are not a problem because they are ordered to be quarantined during which it is observed whether they become symptomatic, and if they do, they are reclassified as confirmed cases.\nSpeaking in general, not in the Chinese case, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Wednesday that isolation measures \"are the best way to stop transmission so that when they are lifted, there will be no coronavirus resurgence\". He left an alert: \"the last thing a country needs is to open schools and businesses and be forced to close them immediately afterwards because of a resurgence.\"\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe only specialist to speak outside of anonymity in the Financial Times article is Cao Jingchao, one of the heads of the pharmacy wing of the internment of one of Wuhan's hospitals. \"Some hospitals nearby transferred their patients to us,\" he reported. \"But we were not informed whether they were new confirmed cases, whether they were patients who were still in those hospitals and, if that were the case, how long they had been hospitalized,\" he said, noting that medical records\nPatient tips were not available.\nOn the 15th of March, they entered the hospital where about 100 patients with covid-19 work, some of which were from other hospitals.

Beijing thanked several countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea, for sending medical supplies.\n\"We note that prices have risen all over the country, which makes it impossible to make more donations\", Xia lamented. \"We believe that most Portuguese are kind and considerate, so we choose to live here,\" he said.\nIn China, too, some supermarkets are charging up to ten times the original price and allegations have emerged about criminal groups selling masks used as new ones.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Industry acknowledged this week that the costume manufacturing plants are only operating at 70% maximum capacity, as the epidemic occurred at the same time as the Lunar New Year holiday, which the government has extended to limit the risk of contagion.\nThe country increased imports of masks from Europe, Japan and the United States, according to the same source.\nThe vast majority of deaths and cases of infection with the new coronavirus are concentrated in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan.\nBy January 23, Wuhan was placed under quarantine, with exits and entrances forbidden by authorities for an indefinite period. The measure was, however, extended to fifteen more Chinese cities close to Wuhan, affecting more than fifty million people as a whole.\nDoctors from all over China have been sent to the region, where hotels and stadiums are being converted to hospitals, to respond to the rapid spread of the virus.\nWuhan also started on Tuesday transferring the first patients to a hospital built on record ten days deadline. Another hospital, even larger, with capacity for 1.600 beds, is under construction in the city and should open in a few days.\nAbout 200 cases were identified in more than twenty countries and on Wednesday a patient died in the Chinese special administrative region of Hong Kong.\nIn a packet kept in quarantine off Japan, the number of cases detected rose to 20 after the 273 of the 3.700 passengers on board were observed. The ship's contagion began with a man who landed on the bellhop's passage through Hong Kong in January.\nLast Thursday, the World Health Organisation declared an international public health emergency. This presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.\n"}, {"content": "All four suspected coronavirus cases tested negative - MoH. Please email to sales@bernama.com for full details about this news.\n"}, {"content": "The economic impact of the epidemic. A black swan is wandering in Asia, and its global impact remains to be determined. Wuhan coronavirus is an example of a manual emergency that affects health and economy. With the improvement of economy and living standards, protein consumption in emerging countries has increased sharply. Interaction between animal viruses and human diseases. A known risk, but unfortunately more and more frequent. It may slow down, but it may also become a global epidemic. The most similar experience in the past was the SARS virus from 2002 to 2003. Since then, prevention mechanisms and responses to health warnings have improved across Asia. In a country like South Korea, I saw with my own eyes a few days ago that although the incidence is almost zero, the public information in health networks and measures is considerable.\nWhat is being dealt with is a major uncertainty, which has had a significant negative impact on the economy. So far, the consequences of such events have lasted only a few months. In any case, this is not a great remission, because if coronavirus becomes a pandemic, its impact may worsen to some extent. The weak resilience of the global economy in 2020 is undergoing the evolution of China's economy, and coronavirus is of no help. The first reaction is already obvious. They come at the price of crude oil. The decline in demand - including a decline in China's industrial activity and land and air transportation - reduced the price of Brent crude oil by 6% last week alone.\nValue indices and stock volatility have yet to respond significantly to these concerns. But in the market analysis forum, the risk of infection is everywhere. If this and other geopolitical risks - such as tensions with Iran - are no longer reflected in the market, it is because these risks are more prominent than the central bank. Loose monetary policy seems to weaken the ability to send warning signals.\nIn the event of an epidemic, experience shows that the values of emerging enterprises may be affected, with a decline of up to 20%. SARS killed 800 people and cost an estimated $50 billion. More than 40 million Chinese citizens have been isolated, but some analysts worry that the protection circle is too late. It rekindled the medical debate about whether the extensive use of antibiotics in animal farms has a negative impact on human immunity. Strengthening the prevention mechanism is conducive to preventing the spread of the pandemic. On the contrary, the virus takes five days to show symptoms. There are some hypotheses about its origin, but it has not been officially confirmed.\n"}, {"content": "explainer: why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroqu\nine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

In the study published this Thursday, researchers discovered that this strain of virus is a mixture or combination of two coronavirus- one infecting bats, another of unknown origin so far, but after the genes of several animal species analysed everything points to snakes as the modifying agent.\nResearchers not involved in the ongoing study, however, question the findings of teachers at Chinese universities, ensuring Paul Eduardo Paixon, virologist at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, that there is \"no scientific evidence\" that the snake can be host to the virus in question.\nThis Thursday, the World Health Organisation decided not to proceed with the declaration of an international public health emergency.\n"}, {"content": "Malaysia confirms 16th case of coronavirus.

After three meetings, the World Health Organisation (WHO) decided that the coronavirus outbreak should be classified as a public health emergency of international interest. What can that change from the various containment measures applied around the world? Little or little. Obviously, the health authorities did not wait for the WHO's decision to proceed with all control measures, under the precautionary principle.\nThe fact that the new coronavirus has already entered 18 countries after the identification of the outbreak in December in Wuhan, China, and the confirmation of transmission of the disease between humans outside Chinese territory have led the WHO to summon experts once again. The emergency committee met for the third time in a week to discuss the need to declare a global public health emergency. Currently, there are 98 cases in 18 countries outside China, including eight cases of person-to-person transmission in four countries: Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the USA.\nWhen the meeting was still taking place the WHO daily report on the coronavirus on Thursday, it updated the numbers rising from 15 to 18 countries affected compared to the day before. It was also pointed out that the new cases detected in Finland, the Philippines and India have some connection to travel to the city of Wuhan. In the bulletin, the WHO referred to 7818 confirmed cases and 170 deaths. However, the updated numbers at the beginning of the night pointed to 8235 infected patients, with 171 dead, according to a team at Johns Hopkins University (US) that monitors the situation. \"We must remember that they are not just numbers, they are people,\" said the Director-General of the WHO.\nInvoking an International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) is basically the most important sign the WHO can give the world. The rules of this process say that in order to declare a PHEIC the situation under consideration must meet three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, This is the sixth time that the WHO has made use of this global warning instrument, with a risk that presents a high risk to public health in other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n\"Let us be clear, this statement is not a vote of lack of confidence in China,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO to journalists. \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,\" he added. The WHO panel, chaired by Didier Houssin of France, is composed of 16 independent experts. \"The main reason for this statement is not what is happening in China, but what is happening in other countries,\" he said.\nWith this new designation to classify the new coronavirus epidemic that was detected in December in China, the WHO can make recommendations to all countries to control the outbreak. Something you started doing a long time ago. It may also issue recommendations on passenger travel and surveillance at international airports and other ports of arrival. That will not be necessary either because many countries have already moved towards such containment measures.\n\"The WHO does not recommend restricting travel, trade and movement and is even opposed to all travel restrictions,\" said the WHO Director-General at the press conference this Thursday at the end of the day at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\nThe WHO decision may also lead to increased funding and resources to contain the outbreak. That is, at first sight, the main difference that we can see from the last few days. However, it is not easy to imagine how countries can further reinforce the effort they have shown in monitoring, detecting and monitoring new cases.

The incubation period varies between two and 12 days\nThe money may serve to impose further measures on the ground, but also to invest in the scientific machine that has been working in this field since very early on. The first genome of the virus has been shared by the team of China with the\ninternational community at the beginning of this month. This Thursday, once again, the Director-General of the WHO praised China for cooperating throughout the process. \"We would have seen many other cases outside China- and probably dead if it weren't for the government's efforts and the progress they made to protect the population of China and the whole world.\"\n\"The only way to defeat this outbreak is with all countries working together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation,\" concluded Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and left the warning in appeal: \"This is the moment of facts, not of fear. This is the moment of science, not of rumours. This is the moment of solidarity, not of stigma.\"\nIt will be possible, with the cooperation of all countries, to reduce the number of infected people, and that is the key to stopping the epidemic, he says to PUBLIC Nuno Faria, associate professor in genetic epidemiology at Oxford University, United Kingdom. \"there are two ways to reduce the number of infected people.\" \"One is through vaccines and treatment, which unfortunately are not yet available for the new virus. Although there are already teams in mainland China, the United States and Hong Kong, working on a vaccine will take some time before we have an effective vaccine. aim to reduce contact between infected people and those still susceptible to the new virus.\"\nThe Alliance for Epidemic preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced shortly after three different research teams are trying to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus. The aim is to start clinical trials for at least one of the vaccines in June.\nResearch teams will have different approaches: one will be led by the Modern Pharmaceutical Company in conjunction with the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the USA; another by the company Inovio; and the third by a team from the University of Queensland in Australia. \"There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work will be a significant and important step in the development of a vaccine for this disease,\" stated Richard Hatchett, Executive Director of CEPI.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe fact is that the cases of infection this week have increased substantially, and it is a reflection of increased monitoring. \"In just one week at least seven universities and public health institutions have designed and shared with the community new diagnostic methods for the new virus. With increasing cases to be tested, an increase in the number of confirmed cases is expected as well\", said Nuno Faria.\nThe impact of this new virus will depend on several factors that are not yet completely or completely clear, including mortality rate and its transmissibility, i.e. how easily it spreads in the population. Current estimates place the mortality rate of 2019-nCoV below the 3s. \"To contextualize, the other coronaviruses that caused recent outbreaks like SARS [in 2003] and MERS [in 2012] have a much higher mortality rate in the order of 10% and 37% respectively. However, one of the concerns regarding the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is more easily transmitted between humans compared to their cousins'SARS and MERS, underlines the Portuguese epidemiologist cooperating with the WHO.\nThe last time the WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola virus outbreak, which is still ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has already killed more than 2000's people. The WHO also considered the following epidemics as international public health emergencies: in 2016, the Zik virus a; in 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11.000 people between 2014 and 2016; in 2014, polio; in 2009, swine flu (the H1N1 virus).\n"}, {"content": "Exclusive: Citadel turns 2020 profit after spotting virus risk early. BOSTON (Reuters) - Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund giant led by billionaire Ken Griffin, has so far weathered the coronavirus market storm well, turning a slight profit in its flagship Wellington hedge fund for the year through Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nThe fund, which practices a so-called multi-strategy array of bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders, was as of Friday down 5.25% for March, the person said, who requested anonymity because the information is private. The exact year-to-date gain, which is net of fees, was not finalized.\nBy comparison, Goldman Sachs’ prime services division estimated that the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 15.5% for the month through Thursday, with average year-to-date losses at nearly 16%.\nCitadel’s multi-strategy competitors are still down for the year amid the coronavirus-led market rout. Millennium Management LLC’s main hedge fund is down about 4.3% for 2020 through March 20, while Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC is down about 15% through March 16, according to people briefed on the returns.\nThe exact drivers of Citadel’s relative outperformance were unclear. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Citadel’s fixed-income portfolio recently lost hundreds of millions of dollars, in part from so-called basis trades on pricing gaps between U.S. Treasuries and futures, although those unrealized losses were recovered within days. The Citadel Global Fixed Income Fund is now positive for the year through Monday, the person with knowledge of Citadel said.\nCitadel showed it was thinking about coronavirus and its market impact relatively early.\nOn Feb. 6, Griffin called the coronavirus “probably the most concrete short-run risk we see in the financial markets globally” during an appearance at The Economic Club of New York.\n“It’s not a Chinese health crisis. It is a global health crisis,” he said.\nCitadel had three days earlier announced that its executives had mobilized $7.5 million to support relief efforts in the United States and China, including more than $1 million in medical supplies to a hospital in hard-hit Wuhan.\nThe firm recently set up the Citadel Relative Value Fixed Income Fund, according to a March 13 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a bid to take advantage of new market volatility.\nCitadel has placed an emphasis on risk management since the last financial crisis, when its main funds lost 55% over 2008 and were forced to temporarily limit client withdrawals.\nIts website touts “a quarter of a century establishing risk management as a core discipline” and a global risk management center in Chicago, anchored by a 27 foot by 8 foot data visualization touchscreen.\nThe firm still uses significant leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify its potential profits. A Jan. 17 SEC filing notes regulatory assets under management of about $194 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018, implying leverage of approximately six and a half times Citadel’s $30 billion in invested assets as of February, according to its website.\n2020 marks 30 years since Citadel was founded by Griffin, who famously started the firm after trading from his Harvard College dorm room. The annualized return for Citadel’s Wellington fund, launched in 1990, was 18.78% net of fees through 2019, the person said, more than double the S&P 500 Index.\n"}, {"content": "Wuhan's authority admits to withholding information about coronavirus and making it available. Zhou Xianwang, President of Wuhan City Council, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was initially detected, admitted to hiding information about the outbreak.

Xianwang also confessed that the transmission was being made between people and not through bacteria or other means.\nWith the revelation this Monday on Chinese state television, the municipality concluded that the only way out was to make the position available. The same was done by the secretary of the Communist Party of China in Wuhan, Ma Guoqiang. \"Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is beneficial to the control of the disease and the life and safety of the people, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will assume any responsibility,\" he said.\nThe number of cases of infection in Wuahn has increased 50% only in the last weekend, which has led authorities to announce the construction of a second emergency hospital with room for 1300 patients, the first one opens on February 3rd and will have a thousand beds.

Many Chinese netizens were outraged by what they reported to be a series of errors that occurred during the above-mentioned press conference, in which three local authorities participated.\nThe governor of Hubei Province (where Wuhan City is located), Wang Xiaodong, was at the conference without wearing a mask, violating the rules that make it mandatory to use in public spaces. Mayor Zhou Xianwang, on his side, remembered the mask, but used it backwards, causing jokes on the Weibo social network, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.\nThe mayor of Wuhan had already been heavily criticised for having authorized a giant feast, which 40 thousand families were invited to celebrate the Chinese New Year, to be held in January 18th and 19. Critical comments are the exceptions in the midst of censorship that the Chinese Government continues to promote on the Internet, including publications deleted from social media, deleted news or investigations by supposed \"fake news\".

SHANGHAI: The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed 17 people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat - setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's Internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game - 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n  \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS 'SPILLOVER' \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats - or for purported health benefits. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n  \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of ... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram\n"}, {"content": "coronavirus cases in china's hubei fall for second day, apple and markets feel impact.

Vinaya Chandran knew exactly what he wanted to do even before he was released from the army quarantine camp in Manesar, Har­yana eat a home-cooked meal with his family in his hometown Alappuzha in Kerala. The camp has looked after us well. We have all become close friends. But the food is not what I am used to, says the 31-year-old medical student from Wuhan University, China. He and the 647 other Indians evacuated from Wuhan on January 30 and February 1 in two batches were released on February 19 after they tested negative for the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). However, to avoid taking chances, each person has been home quarantined for an additional 14 days, with their respective district hospitals monitoring the situation. With over 80,239 cases worldwide and 2,700 deaths (as of February 26), the human cost of nCoV has been making headlines since December 2019, and no country wants to take the threat lightly. The virus was first identified as nCoV, then changed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and finally named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization.\nThe devastating effects of a virus pandemic are being felt all the more by the global community this time around, because of the visual outpouring from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. This is not a tragedy happening in a forgotten corner of the planet. It is unfolding in the heart of the world’s largest economy. Footage of helpless residents not being able to come close to their own family and desperate foreigners begging to return to their home countries have been doing the rounds for over two months. In India, the impact of nCoV has been considerably small, with just three confirmed outbreaks in Kerala. All of whom have now recovered and are under medical supervision. The state has experienced virus outbreaks before and its health department began precautionary measures for nCoV even before they were implemented at a national level.\nIndia might have escaped nCoV, but given the worrying trend of virus outbreaks every few years, we need to ask do we have a system in place to handle a Wuhan-sized pandemic?\nThe burden of control and eradication of disease when it reaches alarming proportions does not fall entirely on a country’s health system. It is supported by various other agencies. While in India, the ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal ministry handling biological and health emergencies, such crises also come under the purview of disaster management agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC). India has pioneered the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness’ which identifies risks, implements disaster risk reduction measures and prepares and operationalises readiness for a broad range of disasters, including diseases and outbreaks, says Professor S.S. Vasan, an Indian-origin scientist who is leading the vaccine development against the nCoV at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia.\nHowever, for a long time, disaster management in India followed no defined path and remained an informal state subject, since after the Bengal famine of 1943 it was assumed that the only disasters India could face would be related to food shortages. There was no mention of disaster management in the Constitution as a state or a central subject. Despite such calamities as the 1950 Assam earthquake or the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984, it was only after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and the setting up of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in 2005 that disaster management protocols and policies were evolved. An outbreak of nCoV, a biological disaster, would be part of Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. As such the states or the health ministry can request additional assistance from the NDMA, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) as well as the armed forces.\nA NATION ALERTED\nThe standard procedure for a health emergency would start at the point of outbreak, then be tackled from a state perspective and, finally, be seen through a national lens. However, when the threat is coming from an international source, like nCoV, the system is reversed. The first level of action is national to prevent the virus from reaching Indian soil.\nIndia’s initial response to nCoV was slow compared to other countries. The outbreak in Wuhan began to show signs of a serious epidemic in early J\nanuary, and the European countries, Singapore, Japan and the US began to trace and isolate their China returnees almost immediately. In India, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) only monitors public health. We are yet to establish an organisation meant to watch health emergencies around the world, a practice followed by many countries in the West. As a result, India began rolling out its emergency health machinery to tackle nCoV only by the end of January.\nA group of ministers (GoM) was constituted on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 30 and held its first meeting on February 3 for the management of nCoV. Members included the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, minister of civil aviation Hardeep S. Puri, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, minister of state for home G. Kishan Reddy, minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, and minister of state for shipping Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nFollowing the first meeting, the health ministry addressed four key issues a risk advisory, travel screening, lab testing and quarantine facilities. Screening posts were set up at 21 international airports and 12 major ports. Staff at these entry points were trained to screen for possible infections after the Ebola outbreak in 2014, when the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) outlined the roles of health officers at airports to handle future infections. Passengers from suspected routes are given a leaflet to check if they are displaying certain symptoms and then screened on deboarding. Immigration officers and security personnel have been sensitised on how to handle passengers and equipped with personal protection equipment. Around 4,214 flights and 448,449 passengers have been screened till date.\nThe second step was to isolate China returnees and suspected cases. A total of 23,259 people have been brought under community surveillance. Every state is equipped with a rapid response team and government hospitals in each district are marked as isolation wards. The health teams can also ask for private hospitals to be on standby in Delhi, for instance, both RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital have 25-bed isolation wards for nCoV cases. In case of a pandemic, hospitals will suspend regular work, which takes up about 80 per cent of the beds, to accommodate more patients, says Dr Jagdish Prasad, former director general of health services. Zika and Ebola, he says, were major turning points for health emergency services in India. We started to rethink our requirements for disease control at a national level, adds Prasad, who is also the founder principal of Safdarjung Hospital and presently a principal consultant with the DGHS.\nThe National Institute for Virology (NIV) Pune, one of the 15 global laboratories identified by the WHO to provide reference testing for the nCoV, was also put on alert. Though India has a long way to go for native virological studies and vaccine development teams, we are not too far behind either in terms of laboratory training and testing. The US’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, has been training lab staff in India to handle, test and identify viruses. The NCDC, too, is equipped to support labs in testing. There are 105 viral research and diagnostic labs across India to support NIV if needed. For nCoV, 2,707 samples have been sent so far to NIV for a full report; only three from Kerala have tested positive.\nThe health ministry has issued advisories for the public, health workers and airport and lab staff, including travel and discharge advisories, guidelines for managing infected persons, isolating patients, and packaging and transporting test samples.\nDISASTER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES ON STAND BY\nIn the event that a health outbreak is identified as a national threat, each state has a disease surveillance programme which sends a daily report to the NCMC and the NDMA. The latter then view the crisis from a national and inter-state perspective and work with state teams to recommend measures, check resources and connect states to border and central agencies, if needed. The first step was to have screenings at all porous and non-porous borders, and identify isolation wards. In Kerala, for example, there were two hospitals in each district where isolation wards for nCoV cases were set up, says Saurabh Dalal, consultant for medical preparedness and biological disasters, NDMA, who was in Kerala to monitor nCoV management. Goin\ng forward, we plan to have a pandemic preparedness plan for each district. Only when all community resources have been exhausted will assistance from NDRF be requested. As it was during the Nipah outbreak of 2018, the NDRF is on stand-by were nCoV to turn into a serious health pandemic. The NDRF functions as a force of assistance to states under the assumption that there is a requisition made, says S.N. Pradhan, director general of NDRF. We have 12 battalions and 18 specialised teams, two of which are specifically trained to handle biological emergencies. Once nCoV was identified as a possible threat, we distributed about 100 suits to our battalions and sent our doctors to sensitise the immigration bureau that would be dealing directly with passengers from high-risk routes. In China, a 1,000-bed hospital was set up within 10 days and Wuhan was cordoned off. In India, the army can rapidly deploy such resources and shut down a state if needed. But it can be decided only at the cabinet level, along with the ministry of home affairs, says Pradhan.\nSTATE ACTION PLAN\nStates can use disaster response funds from the NDMA to detect and handle a crisis. Each state is also equipped with district emergency centres, and district magistrates become incident commanders. A private limited company under the state health department and the National Health Mission maintains stockpiles of personal protection equipment, masks and biological suits.\nKerala became the first state to declare a state emergency for a public health disaster. It was lifted within the first week of February. Widely praised for its handling of the nCoV crisis, not only did Kerala ensure mass isolation for suspected cases, it also made sure that 4 million children in schools were educated about the virus. Special advisories were issued for the blind, elderly, illiterate, differently-abled and health workers (demographic segments often overlooked during disaster communication). However, it is important to note state discrepancies in cases of health crises. Kerala enjoys a better quality of public healthcare and better health indicators than several northern states. Not every state has the capacity to handle a virus outbreak in the same manner. The NDMA has plans to document Kerala’s management of nCoV as a future example to other states.\nOverall, our health disaster management largely rests on short-term steps for control and eradication. The long-term repercussions still need to be considered. There are other aspects of a pandemic that could have crippling effects on morale and economy. Food shortages, financial loss, miscommunication and human rights abuse are aspects of disaster management that have never been handled before. The 2003 SARS outbreak, for instance, is estimated to have resulted in global economic losses to the tune of $30-100 billion, according to the Asian Development Bank; nCoV is predicted to have a similar impact.\nAnother loophole in the system is the presence of multiple agencies the health and home ministries, NCMC, NDMA, NDRF, NCDC and state health departments each with a stake in biological disaster management. Having too many bureaucratic players inevitably leads to longer decision time, confusion and overlap in responsibilities. While we have the guidelines on paper, real life implementation is an altogether different story.\n"}, {"content": "a black swan arrives: investors keep watch as covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments. The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is also affecting investments. \n Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. \n IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS \n Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. \n Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. \n Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). \n They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.  \n The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. \n MARKET FORECASTS \n While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal’s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a “fool’s errand” to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. \n If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.  \n Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. \n Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and “is likely to worsen before getting better”. \n Here in Singapore, DBS bank said that the outbreak has thrown the Singapore economy a curveball. \n Supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within China will have a significant impact on Singapore’s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives. \n As a result, “we are downgrading our 2020 real GDP forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. The concern is that the impact could be deeper than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).” \n Over in Hong Kong, The Guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.   POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO PROTECTIVELY \n Amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring. \n “When you don’t know,” Mr Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates told MarketWatch, “the best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.” \n So far, he said, “fears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a ‘flight-to-quality’ that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (US) dollar.” \n British financial research firm Trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options. \n For stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home. \n Investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market. \n While JPMorga\nn Chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as Sars and Zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the MSCI Hong Kong index lost about 9 per cent during the Sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view. \n Investment brokerage Schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. “A short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,” it said. \n While there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified. \n Given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio. \n Even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial.\n"}, {"content": "Barcelona donates 30.000 masks to the health authorities of Catalonia.

SINGAPORE - Singapore banks' loan growth will slow to 1.5 per cent in 2020, down from 3.1 per cent last year, given the stiff economic headwinds facing Singapore from the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, Fitch Solutions Macro Research forecast in a report released on Friday (Feb 14). \n The likelihood of a more pronounced slowdown is likely to weigh on credit demand, with businesses across a broad range of sectors including retail, tourism and the export-oriented manufacturing sector, likely to encounter tougher conditions as a result of the cornavirus epidemic around the world, said the research firm. It nopted that Singapore banks have already been contending with a contraction in consumer loan growth. \n Furthermore, likely monetary easing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would prevent interest rates from falling too far to offset lower credit demand, it said. \n Fitch Solutions said that while interest rates would normally fall in order to adjust to lower credit demand, Singapore is likely to undergo monetary easing in 2020 in a bid to support the economy, especially the exporting sectors, limiting the extent to which this is possible. \n Unlike other countries which use interest rates as the policy lever, Singapore uses the exchange rate instead. Easing monetary policy under such a system tends instead to have an upward effect on interest rates as they would adjust to maintain the attractiveness of assets denominated in the Singapore dollar, all other things equal. Therefore, as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) rises in tandem with a weaker Singapore dollar, banks will find it hard to lower their rates significantly to bolster credit demand, further weighing on loan growth. Sibor is a key benchmark rate to price most home loans here. \n Its report comes a day after DBS flagged the risks to its earnings from the virus outbreak as it announced quarterly and full-year results.. CEO Piyush Gupta said that if the outbreak is controlled by the summer,  the hit to revenue could be 1 to 2 per cent. OCBC and United Overseas Bank are set to announce their results on Feb 21. \n Fitch Solutions observed that loan growth last year was due to a recovery in lending to businesses that began in April 2019, in line with Singapore's stronger economic performance towards the latter half of 2019. But consumer loans (around 40 per cent of total loans) remained in contraction last year, mostly a reflection of the cooling property market and by extension, slower mortgage growth. \n However, the recovery in business loans (around 60 per cent of all loans) is unlikely to be sustainable in 2020 given that Singapore's open economy is heavily exposed to the likely deeper slowdown in the Chinese economy from the Covid-19 outbreak, said Fitch Solutions. It has revised down China's 2020 real GDP growth to 5.6 per cent from 5.9 per cent. \n \"As a result, our current 2020 real GDP growth forecast of 1.7 per cent for Singapore is exposed to heavy downside risks, and we will revisiting this figure over the coming weeks,\" said the firm. \n The report also noted that Singapore's export-oriented manufacturing sector is closely tied to those of China's economy and that the outbreak will hit a sector already weakened by the ongoing US-China trade war and the slowdown in China. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports posted 12 straight months of contraction at an average pace of 10.8 per cent year on year between December 2018 and November 2019, it calculated. \n It also said the tourism and related hospitality and retail sectors in Singapore will take a hit, not just from the plunge in Chinese visitors, who make up 18.5 per cent of arrivals here, but also as the climbing infection toll in Singapore and the Orange outbreak response level likely deters visitors from other countries as well. \n Fitch Solutions is part of the Fitch Group, which also comprises credit rating agency Fitch Ratings.\n"}, {"content": "Two Malaysian evacuees from Wuhan positive for coronavirus - Health Minister.

The new entry ban won't affect travelers who need to transfer flights at Russian airports, authorities said.\nSo far, Russia has had only three confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus - two Chinese citizens who were treated and released, and a Russian national infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship now quarantined in Japan.\nHowever, Russian authorities have taken significant steps to try to keep the virus from spreading, including hospitalizing hundreds of people as a precaution after they returned from China.\nRussia halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens. Chinese students studying in Russia were told not to return until March 1.\nEarlier this month, the prime minister said Russia might start deporting the foreigners infected with the virus.\nIn the meantime, Germany is sending a second shipment of medical aid supplies to China to help the Asian giant fight the coronavirus epidemic.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the government would send 8.7 tons of aid supplies worth 150,000 euros ($162,000), including protection gear and disinfectants.\n\"Germany stands firmly on the side of China in the battle against coronavirus and works closely and trustfully with the Chinese officials,\" Maas said. \"We have the utmost respect for the efforts China has already undertaken.\"\nThe virus, which emerged in central China in December, has killed 1,868 patients in mainland China and five others elsewhere. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19.\nChina has instituted a strict lockdown on over 60 million people in central Hubei province and other nations are taking their own measures - including mandatory 14-day quarantines - to stop the virus from getting established on their territory.\nEurope has had one virus death among its 47 confirmed cases, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in Paris who was initially turned away by two French hospitals.\nItaly says 14 of 25 Italian crew members aboard the troubled Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been struck under quarantine in Japan, will take an Italian evacuation military flight home. The other 11, including the captain of the ship, will stay, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. No date for the Italian air force plane's departure for Japan has been decided yet.\nThe Russian Embassy in Japan announced Tuesday that one Russian was among the 542 people on the Diamond Princess confirmed with the virus. The statement clarified earlier reports about two Russians getting infected.\nOn Monday, a Russian court sent a woman who broke out of a locked hospital during a 14-day isolation period back into quarantine. Russian health authorities are suing others who have defied quarantine requirements.\n"}, {"content": "China on alert. Three cities quarantined due to the deadly virus.

Brent values dropped more precipitously than US crude because China is the top destination for crude that is priced relative to Brent, said Kilduff.\n"}, {"content": "WHO says 'no known effective' treatments for new coronavirus. GENEVA (REUTERS) - The World Health Organization played down media reports on Wednesday (Feb 5) of “breakthrough” drugs being discovered to treat people infected with the new coronavirus, which is causing an epidemic in China and has spread to at least 20 other countries. \n A Chinese TV report said researchers at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while Britain’s Sky News said researchers had made a “significant breakthrough” in developing a vaccine. Oil prices jumped on the reports. \n Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.”  \n The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures. \n Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year. \n Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development. \n The US drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage. \n “It is not approved anywhere globally,” a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing. \n Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks.  \n “We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV,” the spokesman said.\n"}, {"content": "How coronavirus is affecting India's Olympics preparations. \nThe novel coronavirus outbreak has affected their Olympic preparations, but India's top athletes, like P V Sindhu and Bajrang Punia, say they are optimistic about the quadrennial event going ahead as scheduled despite the current health crisis.\nRio Olympics silver medallist Sindhu says she can understand the apprehensions of fellow-shuttlers, including compatriot Sania Nehwal, who is racing against time to qualify for the Games due to the cancellation of tournaments in the wake of the outbreak.

SINGAPORE — Aviation and tourism-related stocks in Singapore tanked on Monday (March 16) as investors reacted to additional travel restrictions imposed by the Singapore Government over the weekend in a bid to slow the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Analysts say the death knell was the extension of the restrictions to travellers from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which are Singapore's closest neighbours — and include some of the world’s busiest air routes. \n It was a bloodbath for the Straits Times Index (STI) on Monday, with aviation and tourism stocks particularly hard hit. It came amid massive selloffs on stock markets around the world as fears over the economic impact of Covid-19 verge on full-blown panic. \n Singapore Airlines slumped 6.34 per cent to end the day at S$6.74, a more than 15-year low. SIA last traded at this level in October 2004. Genting Singapore, which owns Resorts World Sentosa among other leisure industry properties, slid by 5.88 per cent to S$0.64. \n Far East Hospitality Trust dived 10.38 per cent to S$0.48, while CDL Hospitality Trust sank 10.71 per cent to close the day at S$1. \n Both counters are business trusts that have hotels in their portfolios. \n The STI, as a whole, lost 5.25 per cent, ending the day at 2,495.7 points. \n On Sunday, the Government announced that all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom in the previous 14 days will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice. \n Singaporeans are also advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad with immediate effect, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. \n About 40 per cent of international arrivals into Changi Airport are from Asean countries, almost four times more than Chinese travellers, said Mr Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities. \n Asean comprises Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar and Singapore. \n “By default, half of the business disappeared overnight. It’s quite devastating,” he said. \n In 2019, three flight routes within Asean were among the world’s top five busiest flight routes of the whole year, according to travel data provider OAG. \n The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route topped the list at 30,187 flights, while the Singapore-Jakarta route came in third at 27,046 flights. \n The Kuala Lumpur-Jakarta route took fifth spot at 19.741 flights every year. \n Already, Singapore has progressively banned travellers from China, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea and Spain from entering the country. \n These newest restrictions on Asean nationals, would “kill a lot of business travel”, said Mr Terence Wong, founder of Azure Capital. \n “Most of them are intra-Asean travel, probably just in the country a day or two right? There is no reason why you want to be subjected to a 14-day stay-at-home requirement,” he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG, said that the market selloff is not just due to restrictions imposed in Singapore. \n Australia and New Zealand, which are destinations close to Asean, have also put up restrictions as part of their containment efforts. \n “There is a consolidated effort across the board,” she said. \n Yet while the market is down dramatically, analysts to whom TODAY spoke said investors should exercise caution and not rush in just because share prices look very cheap. \n While Asian countries, such as Singapore, are generally perceived to be doing a better job at containing the Covid-19 outbreak, Ms Pan noted that financial markets here are still influenced externally, particularly with what’s going on in the United States. \n Over the past week, financial markets in the US have suffered whiplash, rising and falling dramatically — but the net movement is a huge dive, from above 29,000 points in mid February to just above 22,000 in early trading on Monday. \n Last Thursday, the US market suffered its single largest percentage fall — 9.5 per cent — since Oct 19, 1987 when the US market lost 25 per cent in a single session. \n “The outlook for the US market in the short-term, and I mean in the next one month, the outlook is not so positive. I don’t recommend trying to catch this falling knife at this point in time,” said Ms Pan. \n Mr Wong also warned not to jump into the market as there might be more downside risk in the future. \n Howev\ner, Mr Chew said it is a good time to buy though his advice would be to pace the investments as the situation is still deteriorating. \n “The market will remain weak until we reach a peak in the number of new patients… Whenever the numbers rise, the market will take it that the detrimental economic impact will be more entrenched,” he said. \n “The positive side is we see that the virus can be contained but at the cost of huge economic damage.” \n  \n"}, {"content": "What if the virus reaches Africa?. Four continents have already reached the new Coronavirus: from China people have carried it to other parts of Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. In Africa, however, it has not yet arrived. But what if? The pathogen t hat has already killed 500-people and infected tens of thousands of people would hit countries here whose health systems are as weak as perhaps anywhere else in the world. Worst case scenario, it could mean an epidemic of hundreds of thousands of infected and thousands of dead. Because many regions in sub-Saharan Africa already have major problems today: epidemics of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis, and an increase in chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure not only weaken people, but overload countries where it is to hospitals, doctors, Nurses and medical care are missing.\nEven if they struggle with numbers and predictions, many experts are very afraid of this scenario. Meeting of the Executive Board of the World Health Organisation on 3rd. In February, the mood among the African Member States was very tense, officials say. And John Nkengasong, who heads the African Union's only three years ago, said TIME ONLINE between two telephone conferences: \"We are facing an unprecedented danger.\"\nEven in the Sars epidemic 2003, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa had largely been spared, with only South Africa registering a single case. With the new Coronavirus, however, no one should hope that it will go so smoothly: the links between China and many African states have become too close. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese guest workers work on the African continent, thousands of African students travel to China on an annual scholarship. Air traffic from Africa to China and back has been declining over the past ten years.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. You're a doctor.\nand physicians assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nMany countries of the continent have strong economic relations with China. Kenya and Ethiopia, for example. For Ethiopia, China is the most important economic partner with a trade volume of more than five billion US dollars. In Kenya, the Chinese government sponsored one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of the country, a high-speed train connecting the capital of Nairobi to the coastal metropolis of Mombasa. The train is part of the New Silk Road Initiative initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping 2013. China is investing billions of euros in infrastructure projects to build global trading bases.\nAnd last week, in both Ethiopia and Kenya, there were several Coronavirus suspected cases, says Michel Yao, who is responsible for emergency programs at the WHO Africa, on the phone. \"We've had many alarms,\" says Yao. This is a good sign, however, because it shows that the monitoring systems worked in many places.\nBut is it true? Or have there been cases in individual African states for a long time that nobody has registered? A report published by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board at least found worldwide gaps in the preparation for epidemics and an investigation by the Center for Health Security of Johns Hopkins University showed that the worst prepared countries are found almost all in Africa. In fact, there is a shortage of everything: laboratories to detect pathogens, isolation rooms and personnel.\nBut first of all, in order to suffocate an epidemic in the germ, good reporting systems are needed. Because the faster cases are detected, the fewer people can infect the infected. John Nkengasong says the African Disease Protection Agency has already set up a task force to assist countries in this. In addition, each country should have a rapid response force, and already today, all airports would be looking for infected people, with questionnaires and temperature scanners. Such a screening would be carried out anyway because of the outbreak of Ebola in Congo that has been going on for a year and a half.\nHowever, it is difficult to say how well these measures really work in the event of a coronation. It certainly also depends on which country in sub-Saharan Africa is dealing with the first cases of corona viruses. Some countries, such as Ghana or Nigeria, are better prepared than regions where war is raging and governments are unstable, such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic. There, for example, the virus is likely to have almost free circulation.\nAlso, finding new cases will not be easy, says Gerard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research: \"In large parts of Africa, people think of malaria first if someone has a fever.\" So it is also a matter of training health professionals that in addition to diseases such as malaria, Lassa, Ebola and meningococcal meningitis could also hide the corona virus behind a fever.\nKrause has been helping Nigeria since 2017 and also recently\nin Ghana to set up a system called Sormas. One has to imagine it as a platform that connects all those involved in a health system digitally: the laboratory, the district doctor, the village health worker and the health authority. For example, if a health care worker suspects an infection with the new corona virus, deposits it on a tablet and takes a blood sample, explains Krause, different things happen at the same time: the laboratory is notified that a sample is on its way. The health authorities and the district doctor receive an alert and the health care worker is instructed to isolate the suspect and search for people he was dealing with.\nIf we succeed in finding a suspect, the question remains as to how it will be confirmed. At the beginning of February, there were only two laboratories throughout Africa testing samples of patients on the 2019-nCoV virus. The evidence of a suspicious case in the Ivory Coast had to be sent to Europe first, said Michael Yao, TIME ONLINE. It took days to establish a false alarm. In the coming days, twelve laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa should be able to test for the new Coronavirus, Yao says. John Nkengasong assumes that he will soon be available in 15 to 20 countries.\nFinding patients quickly and then isolating them is even more important in much of Africa than elsewhere. Because most health systems in sub-Saharan Africa may be too weak to care for the sick in the event of a major corona virus outbreak. There are no surface quarantine stations with ventilation machines used in the event of severe pneumonia caused by the corona virus. In addition, there is a shortage of skilled workers in almost all countries of sub-Saharan Africa. While in Germany statistically approximately 42 doctors arrive at 10.000 people, in Ethiopia there is exactly one, in Somalia even only 0.2*.\nIn many countries, the most elementary is missing, says political scientist Ilona Kickbusch, who has advised the federal government on global health issues: \"This already begins with the protection coat and medicines.\" Also, in many countries with weak health systems, there are logistical problems. Bringing respiratory masks into affected areas can take days, much too long for the contagious corona virus.\nThe weakness of some health systems was also the main reason to call for an international health emergency, said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 30th. January: \"We do not know what damage this virus can do if it spreads to a country with a weaker health system. We must now act to prepare for this possibility.\"\nJohn Nkengasong says: \"I can only call on the international community to help African countries now, and not to wait until the continent is completely overwhelmed.\" An outbreak like in China would not stand up to the health systems of most states.\nThe Gates Foundation, which has been investing millions in global health for years, has already promised Nkengansong's authority four or five million euros to take action against the new Coronavirus. I got 05. In February, the Foundation then declared that it would invest another 90 million euros to combat the Coronavirus, approximately 18 million of which would go to African countries. Some African states, such as Sudan, requested 04. In February, at the meeting of the WHO Executive Board, explicitly asked for help. \"On the one hand, it was about training professionals to prevent and treat the Coronavirus,\" says Mathias Bonk of the Institute for Global Health in Berlin. And secondly, they need materials like test kits, masks and protective suits. Some of these problems are intended to resolve a strategy plan tailored specifically to the new Coronavirus presented by the WHO this week.\nJohn Nkengansong of the African Disease Protection Agency also spoke to the World Bank and asked the public health authorities of the USA and China for logistical assistance. It was precisely the Americans who had helped in recent health crises in sub-Saharan Africa. But what if the US itself experiences a severe corona virus outbreak? This fear is also driving many people around at the moment: that the classical\ncountries could be so busy with outbreaks of the virus that they no longer help.\nMichel Yao says the WHO emergency team is also in contact with non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross and doctors without borders. In some places, if the virus reaches them, African states could benefit from such existing partnerships. In such cases, for example, Ebola treatment centres in the Congo could then be converted to places where people with a coronary virus infection are isolated and treated.\nHowever, Ilona Kickbusch also stresses that it needs not only money and supplies, but also a strategy to explain measures such as quarantine and isolation of patients to the people in the affected areas. so many villagers must have imagined, came, took healthy people and brought back dead. Of course, conspiracy theories emerged, making it even more difficult for treatment teams to gain the trust of the population.\nGerard Krause of the Helmholtz Institute for Infection Research is in contact with various African states. They are thinking about using their Sormas system, just like Ghana and Nigeria. There the system has already helped 2017 and 2018 to control an outbreak of monkey pox, says Krause. Even if it may be too late for the new Coronavirus, another epidemic with a new pathogen is bound to come. This should be prepared by an ever closer-knit Africa.\nRead all about the new Coronavirus on our topic page.\n*Correction note: Initially the text stated how many doctors on 10.000 people in the respective country are coming incorrectly.

(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in Chi\nna’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n"}, {"content": "taiwan embraces cute mascots for virus prevention campaign. TAIPEI — While China deploys stern communist slogans in its battle against a deadly new coronavirus, democratic Taiwan has embraced cuddly mascots and humour to ease public anxiety and educate on best practices. \n Images of cute animals have featured in daily social media updates from government agencies to tackle disinformation and prevent the spread of infections. \n The health ministry has deployed a cartoon \"spokesdog\" — a Shiba Inu called Zongchai — that has proved a hit with hashtags of his name going viral and posts shared hundreds of thousands of times. \n Recent contributions have included advice on hygiene and quarantine regulations as well as reminding people to use face masks judiciously given the ongoing shortages since the new virus exploded in China. \n \"Leave face masks for the people who need them, frequently wash your hands with soap, reduce touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands,\" read one update.  \n A photo illustration shows a man displaying a smartphone with an image of a cartoon of Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang promoting the prevention of the deadly Covid-19 coronavirus, in Taipei, on Feb 14, 2020.

Photo: AFP \n The island — which Beijing views as its own territory and keeps frozen out of the World Health Organization — recorded its first death on Sunday (Feb 16) but has kept confirmed infections to just 20. \n There was brief panic buying of face masks before authorities limited each person to just two face masks every seven days using health insurance cards. \n The island has also restricted the number of face masks a person can take abroad to 250. Last week, the coast guard stopped a fishing boat for attempting to smuggle out 71,000 masks. \n The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which is loathed by Beijing for leaning towards Taiwanese independence, has been deft at deploying cute memes to win public support. \n President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide second term in January after an election where she regularly featured as an anime-style cartoon character in campaign literature. \n In a similar vein, Premier Su Tseng-chang took to his social media accounts in cartoon form this week to warn against panic-buying toilet paper. \n \"We only have one butt, don't hoard, don't trust rumours,\" the post read.  \n Once again, a clever homophone was deployed.

When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger — too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that “the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history”. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country’s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li’s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li’s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. On Feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official Xinhua News Agency for its assertion that “the sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth”. \n A more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state–society relations, centre–local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While\nthe rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

Wuhan's coronavirus not only isolated 46 million people living in the blocked cities of Hubei Province, which is the center of the epidemic. After the World Health Organization (who) announced an international health emergency on Thursday, the whole of China found itself increasingly alienated from the rest of the world. Many airlines have cancelled their routes in China. Some countries have announced the closure of the borders of people in the country over the past 14 days, including third country nationals.\nIn China, the situation created by 2019-ncov has not been alleviated. The number of infected persons is about 14380; The death toll reached 304; 163000 people were observed, of which 19544 were suspected of infection. The good news is that the number of 328 cured patients exceeds the number of deaths. Earlier on Sunday, the Philippine Ministry of Health announced that a 44 year old Chinese man died of coronavirus.\nThe epidemic has spread to 24 countries, with more than 150 cases, including one in Spain. Only Africa and South America remain virus-free.\nAccording to the United States, this situation requires the declaration of a \"public health emergency\" on its territory. This country, the first to announce the repatriation of its citizens after the sudden closure of Wuhan on the 23rd, will close the borders of any foreigners who have no family relationship with American citizens or permanent residents, who are in China two weeks before their arrival, Maximum latency. The veto will take effect on Sunday. In addition, American Airlines also announced the suspension of flights to China.\nOther countries have done the same. The number of grounded notices has doubled this Saturday. In addition to British Airways, Iberia or Lufthansa, there are Qantas in Australia, Vietnam Airlines or flagship companies in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Iran.\nIn the past two weeks, tourists passing through China will not be allowed to enter countries such as Australia, El Salvador, Mongolia, Italy or Singapore.\nThese measures have caused serious anxiety to the Chinese government. The Chinese government tried to solve the epidemic as soon as possible, but did not pay any price. Beijing wants to make it clear that mistakes such as managing SARS, an epidemic similar to nearly 800 deaths worldwide in 2003, will not be repeated.\n\"There is no need to panic unnecessarily or take excessive action,\" Xu Chen, Chinese ambassador to Geneva, said at a press conference The diplomat stressed that who has always stressed that it \"fully believes\" in the ability of the world's second-largest economy to solve the crisis. The United Nations organization sees no need to restrict travel and trade with the Asian country.\nFor this country, closing the border or a large number of foreigners leaving Wuhan is a vote of no confidence in its control measures and health system, although the government itself acknowledges that protective materials are saturated and lacking. In many cases, bureaucratic obstacles delayed flights to repatriate foreigners by hours or days.\nNevertheless, France's second charter plane landed at the eastres Air Force Base in the south of the country on Sunday. 250 foreigners from 30 different nationalities returned from Wuhan. Two days later, the first batch of 180 French citizens arrived from the city identified as coronavirus zero. According to Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian, 65 French and \"many Europeans\" did not show symptoms when boarding. Secretary of state Adrian taquette added that so far, the first batch of returning citizens have not suffered from the disease. Although foreigners plan to be sent to their countries of origin under an undisclosed protocol, including Belgium, Sweden and Norway, The 65 French will be distributed between the resort center 30 kilometers away from Marseille, where the first returnees are located, and a fire school near AIX, Provence.\nAccording to the authorities, EC is completely isolated and accessible.\nTo some extent, there is no doubt that in some decisions to close or open borders, there is a political factor, not just a health factor. Although medical experts have made many suggestions and 13 cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government has so far refused to completely close the border. It has suspended ferry or high-speed train connections and reduced the number of flights to mainland China. The medical workers union threatened to go on strike on Monday if the head of government, Carrie Lam, did not declare a full closure.\nOther countries whose economies are highly dependent on China are also firmly on the side of this big country. Pakistan refused to evacuate university students in Wuhan, despite students' calls for \"solidarity\" with the government in Beijing. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen made a similar point at a press conference held in Phnom Penh on Thursday. He insisted that Cambodian nationals in China, including Wuhan, \"must stay there and help the Chinese people fight this disease. In these difficult times, they do not have to flee the Chinese people.\"\nBut the actions of the United States, in particular, may open up a new front in the difficult relations between the two powers, which signed a nearly two-year trade war truce in December. Before announcing the closure of the border, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said this week that China's coronavirus was beneficial to the United States and forced enterprises to withdraw their supply chains from Asian countries.\n\"The words and deeds of some U.S. officials are neither based on facts nor appropriate,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said in a statement \"When who announced its opposition to travel restrictions, the United States quickly took the opposite approach.

WUHAN/BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - The Chinese doctor who was punished by police for trying to warn the world of the emergence of the new strain of coronavirus died on Friday (Feb 7) from the disease. He was 34. \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of the whistle-blowers on China's coronavirus, officially known as 2019-nCoV, died at 2.58am on Friday in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, the hospital said early on Friday. \n The end came following extraordinary efforts to keep the critically ill doctor alive in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). \n Caixin learnt that treatments included a procedure known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo), which circulates blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream, starting at around 9pm on Thursday. \n News of Dr Li's death broke at around 10pm on Thursday. But the Central Hospital later said on its official Weibo account that a medical rescue effort was still under way. \n Around midnight, a nurse at the hospital told Caixin outside the ICU that Dr Li \"won't make it\". \n Dr Li disclosed on his social media account last Saturday that he had been diagnosed with a 2019-nCoV infection, most likely as a result of treating patients, but said he planned to return to work after recovery. By Wednesday, his condition had worsened, he told Caixin over WeChat. \n \"I haven't felt as good the last couple of days,\" he said. \"It's getting harder to breathe.\" \n An ophthalmologist in Wuhan, Dr Li received national attention after China's top court on Jan 28 criticised Wuhan police for reprimanding eight Wuhan citizens for \"spreading rumours\" about an illness in late December, in a commentary on its official WeChat account. \n Dr Li is considered to be one of the eight, although the police did not identify who specifically they had accused or punished. \n On Dec 30, Dr Li sent a message to his medical school alumni WeChat group, warning that the ophthalmology department in his hospital had put seven patients from a local seafood market into isolation wards after they were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n A screenshot of the message was leaked, and Dr Li was summoned by the hospital's inspection unit for a talk. Later, on Jan 3, he was called in and reprimanded by local police for allegedly spreading rumours online and disrupting social order. \n The commentary posted on the social media account of China's Supreme People's Court said that in retrospect, the eight Wuhan citizens should not have been punished, as what they said was not entirely false. \n \"It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the 'rumours' then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitisation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,\" the commentary said. \n Dr Li told Caixin in an interview on Jan 30 that he had been worried the hospital would punish him for \"spreading rumours\" but felt relieved after the top court publicly criticised the police. \n \"I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society, and I don't approve of using public power for excessive interference,\" Dr Li said. \n A few days after the police summons, Dr Li treated a patient who initially came in for glaucoma but later had a fever. A lung scan showed viral pneumonia. \n On Jan 12, as he felt unwell and was suspected of having contracted the virus, he was moved to an isolation ward, Dr Li told Caixin. His parents were also infected and sent to the hospital. \n On Jan 30, Dr Li said his test result had come back negative, but he remained in the isolation ward. \n He said he did not plan to go through official judicial channels to get an explanation, saying that it would be troublesome for him and the public security bureau. \n \"It's more important that people know the truth,\" Dr Li said. \"Justice is less important to me.\" \n He did take the opportunity, however, to clarify that rumours saying his medical licence was suspended were not true. \n As of Friday morning, China confirmed more than 31,000 coronavirus cases, and the epidemic's death toll had risen past 600. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global.\n"}, {"content": "Lufthansa will stop 150 aircraft due to falling air traffic.

This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE — While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), the scene that played out on Feb 7 at supermarkets across the island was something no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \n Hours before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level from Yellow to Orange. \n The risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?  \n Customers picking out instant noodles and other non-perishables at Giant Supermarket in Beauty World Centre on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange.

As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n Empty shelves at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.   \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun.  \n “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,” said Asst Prof Liew, who teaches at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Mr Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that Mr Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.   \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an\naddress by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after Singapore raised its Dorscon alert level to Orange. Photo: MCI \n ​HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work. \n “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Business owners like Ms Chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.”     \n    \n  \n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 9-Americans disembark from virus-hit cruise; China says new cases slow. SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.\nAn announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.\nSeventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.\nThe ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died.\nCountries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Fie\nld/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.\nThe evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nAnother cruise ship, Holland America’s MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.\nTaiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Pompeo conveyed 'strong U.S. objections' to Beijing over COVID-19 accusations. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A war of words between China and the United States showed no signs of let up on Monday, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call with a top Chinese diplomat expressing “strong U.S. objections” over what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to shift blame for the spread of the coronavirus.\nTies between the world’s top two economies, already complicated due to issues including trade, intellectual property rights as well as press freedoms, have further been tested by the outbreak of coronavirus, which causes the sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness COVID-19.\n“Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” Morgan Ortagus, State Department spokeswoman said in a statement about Pompeo’s call with Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China.\n“The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” Ortagus said.\nThe United States on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very “stern representation” to China’s ambassador Cui Tiankai.\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday that in the phone call Yang told Pompeo that attempts to smear China’s efforts to control the coronavirus “will not succeed” and that actions that harmed China’s interests would be retaliated against.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has spread around the world, upended many countries’ daily lives, pummeled financial markets, brought flights to a standstill, shut down schools and forced the postponement of almost all gatherings including sports and arts events.\nGlobally over 174,100 have been infected and nearly 6,700 have died. U.S. death toll reached 71, with more than 4,100 people having tested positive for the disease.\nBeijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nPompeo, who has sharply criticized Beijing on a number of issues from its trade practices to religious freedoms, has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.\nHowever on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised China for its “data sharing” and appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n"}, {"content": "a third of coronavirus cases may be ‘silent carriers’, classified chinese data suggests. HONG KONG — The number of \"silent carriers\" — people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms — could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. \n That could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally. \n More than 43,000 people in China had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. They were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time. \n Scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases. \n One obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently. \n The World Health Organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. South Korea also does this. But the Chinese government changed its classification guidelines on Feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The United States, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus. \n The approach taken by China and South Korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient — regardless of whether the person has symptoms — may explain why the two Asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. Meanwhile in most European countries and the US, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise. \n A growing number of studies are now questioning the WHO's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". A report by the WHO's international mission after a trip to China estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a European Union paper. \n \"The number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from China and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of Japanese experts led by Mr Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University, wrote in a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in February. \n Based on their research, Mr Nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic Japanese patients evacuated from Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak in China, at 30.8 per cent — similar to the classified Chinese government data. \n But official figures from South Korea — which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of Wednesday — are the most comparable to China's. More than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital. \n \"Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's CDC, told a press briefing on March 16. \n Another useful point of reference is the data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in Yokohama, Japan. All of its passengers and crew were tested, with 712 people testing positive — 334 of whom were asymptomatic, according to official Japanese figures. \n An EU report has put the proportion of asymptomatic cases in Italy at 44 per cent, but in most parts of the country people without symptoms are not tested. \n In Hong Kong, 16 of the 138 confirmed cases as of March 14 were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to Mr Ho Pak-leung, a professor with the microbiology department of the University of Hong Kong. \n All of these numbers point to a significantly higher ratio of asymptomatic cases than indicated by data publicly released by China so far. T\nhere were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, epidemiologists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a paper published online in JAMA Network Open on February 24. \n The WHO has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall. \n However, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated. \n A joint study by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on Jan 23. \n \"These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from Columbia University, the University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Tsinghua University, and the University of California, Davis wrote in the report. \n A separate study by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 Chinese cities. Their findings are awaiting publication in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Ho from the University of Hong Kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms. \n \"Of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. But there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted. \n Mr Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\". \n \"There are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said. \n A better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said. \n \"The asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" Mr Nishiura wrote in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. \"That would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n"}, {"content": "Mask-diplomacy. The airport fire department fired water fountains at the white Boeing 747, which landed at the Belgian airport last Friday. Then half a million respiratory masks, countless bales of protective clothing and test kits for the corona virus were unloaded, which were distributed to several European countries. In the following days other machines came with urgently needed supplies. A donation from the Alibaba Foundation and the Jack Ma Foundation.\nOn Wednesday, 300-Chinese doctors landed in Italy, the country currently worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sun Shuopeng, Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross, was also on board. The following Thursday, according to media reports, he said at a press conference: \"Here in Milan, the area most affected by Covid-19, the lockdown measures are very lax. I see that public transport is still in operation, people are walking around, meeting in hotels and not wearing masks. I don't know what people are thinking.\"\nSuch criticism is, of course, not a typical message from China these days. Most of the time we hear anointing words. China's KP chief and President Xi Jingping, for example, cheered up Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez with the hopeful remark, \"after the storm comes sunshine \"Not without adding, after the pandemic one should think about more intensive cooperation.\nIn a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Xi spoke of a \"Silk Road of Health\" as part of China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. A clear indication that aid for Europeans in need also has a geopolitical aspect (which of course makes it no less valuable). The Chinese Silk Road Initiative is widely viewed as critical in Europe, as expansionism and as a method of driving participating countries into debt dependence with China. The picture is now to be lightened and forgotten that the Corona crisis had begun with China's inaction and cover-up tactics.\nThe fact that China is currently engaged in mass production of protective masks at unprecedented levels in order to make the material available worldwide is reflected prominently in propaganda. \"Trump cannot keep his mask promise without Chinese factories,\" the regime's websites echo. It is even being spread that the virus comes from the US, an astonishingly blunt response to the US President's attempts to use phrases such as \"Chinese virus\" to exploit the health disaster for nationalist purposes.\nOtherwise, however, China presents itself as a friendly superpower full of humanity. And that's what counts. About the old ally of Serbia, whose President Aleksandar Vucic is quoted as saying:'European solidarity does not exist. It is a nursery rhyme. We place our hope in the only country capable of helping us in this difficult situation: the People's Republic of China.'\nThat's where he hits a nerve. Had Germany not initially banned the export of respiratory masks to Italy, and is it not the case that a few kilometres from the distressed Alsace, German intensive care centres have free capacities? And what has become of America, the land of the Carpathians and the Raisin Bombers?\nChina wants to take on this role. Reinforced, with everyone equal in the world. This is the \"Chinese Dream of the Great National Renaissance\", the redemption of Xi Jinpings. For millennia, China has been issuing such a slogan for periods of rule, which is to give its name to the respective era. The concept of the Chinese Renaissance has a centuries-old tradition, but now it is supposed to be under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Corona crisis seemed to shake this course at first, but now Beijing is reversing the energy of this shaking and wants to use it for its own ascent.\n"}, {"content": "US advises citizens against travelling to China.

Worst case scenario, \"I don't know if you have a cold, but it'll slow you down.\" For the President of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), Pedro Costa Ferreira, in an interview with the PUBLIC/Renaissance, who can hear complete this Thursday from thirteen, as far as the new coronavirus is concerned, the important are the numbers and the facts, follow advice to travelers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the indications from the World Health Organisation. The rest is \"noise\", he says, noting that, apart from China and some of Italy, there is no limit to travel.\nSince last weekend there has literally been panic in Europe, the number of countries affected is growing. France, Italy, now Spain, there is talk of many cancelled flights, many customers who do not know whether or not to keep their travel. Is it scaremongering or is it enough to shake the industry? It is a bit of panic, ignorance of the facts, but also a bit of the sector being shaken. I have a feeling that the first thing we need to do before we start talking about the coronavirus is to get out of the disco, it's very noisy. The circus that is assembled around this subject has produced a lot of noise and that noise has made it extremely difficult to shape, frame, and relativize the whole problem.\nLet's set up the problem outside of noise: what we have today and knowing that the numbers are very dynamic. About 80 thousand infected, about 2700 dead, which suggests a downright low mortality rate, especially in comparison with other similar events that had much higher mortality rates. We have nearly thirty thousand patients cured or recovered from infection, which the media circus never points to. This Tuesday I was looking at a television that talked about 80 thousand infected, 2700 dead and nothing else. It should be added: and 30 thousand recovered. And then you have to relativize and frame.\nEvery year in Portugal, about three thousand people must die, each year in Italy, where we count, at the moment we are talking, 12 dead, about eight thousand people die of influenza. Does this mean we don't have a problem? I'm sure you don't. We need to frame him.\nI understand you want to relax, being the president of APAVT, but this Tuesday we heard a world expert who came back from China saying that the world is not prepared for such a thing. If the world is not prepared according to a specialist, it may be good for the industry to prepare, but I am not saying that the sector is not prepared. First of all, I'm relativizing and moving away the circus. Let's talk numbers. That doesn't mean we don't have a problem. But what's the big problem right now? It is the lack of knowledge of the virus, its mode of transmission, its consequences, its timing of transmission, whether it is seasonal or all year round, that is unpredictability. It is the unpredictability that causes this chaos and panic.\nAs far as this unpredictability is concerned, I think there is one way, or several. I think there's a path that is right, that of rationality, that of prudence, and I would even say that of humility. Rationality: let's study, let's follow, let's check the numbers, how it's transmitting, where it's going to end. For example, in China recoveries are happening at a much higher rate than new infected ones, it is a good thing. But in Europe we are starting a process of transmission that is likely to get worse in the coming days, which is a bad thing.\nWe need to be humble about this lack of knowledge. It's a certainty that in two months'time, most likely, we're not all stuck at home without living, but we can be with our lives relatively affected. It's also probably a certainty that we won't have a normal life, but we can have a life very close to normal.\nWhat if we have a trip already purchased to China? If I have a trip to another fifteen days, which I bought at a travel agency, is the agency available to reimburse me for the trip? It is not available, it is legally obliged and already does.\nBut is this for the whole year or for the short term? Talking about refunds has to be case by case. But there are some cases we can determine. Reservations held before the outbreak of the problem, which are to be travelled by the end of March, can be reimbursed, are in the framework of the leg\nExactly. In June, they may not be reimbursed now, so we have to wait for developments.\nAnd when will the problem arise? I think it is December 31. One thing's for sure, a trip booked yesterday is not eligible for reimbursement today. Even because a trip booked yesterday had to come from the travel agent, and that's what dictates the good practices of the travel agency, all the information to the client. The client will know what he's going to find.\nAnd booked eight days ago for Italy? If you go to Northern Italy, including Milan, the answer is very likely to be a refund. It is likely, but once again it must be case by case. When the reservation was made, which is the point, why the person wants to cancel. If it's just a flight you're not entitled to a refund, you have to at least have two services bought from a travel agency. Only flight is not entitled to reimbursement.\nNever! Not even for China?Legally, it's not framed. What is framed by the travel agency law is two services sold at the same time, the most hotel flight, the most transfer flight. What we call organized trips.\nWe always talk about short-term, that is to say, still waiting to see, both by the association and the agencies themselves. Are the decisions you have mentioned an association board to all agencies or can each agency decide otherwise? In the case of China, it is a case of force majeure, there is a discourse at the community portal, so if the journey is organised, and with more than one service, you are entitled to reimbursement. And it has to be said that travel agencies are very prepared for this because they have insurance. A trip to Italy, today, to Milan, has been booked prior to the outbreak of the problem and if it is to be travelled by the end of March, this trip, if organised and booked in a travel agency, is included. If you've been booked outside an agency, you don't have any protection. The problems of travel agencies today are also the opportunities of travel agencies. It is in an agency that the consumer has the greatest protection.\nBetween reason and some scaremongering, which is natural, because we look at our interactive map on the PUBLIC website, where we se e each case emerging and cases approaching and surrounding Portugal, people naturally go into some alarm. Are people already cancelling journeys even to Europe for fear of coronavirus? Are these people entitled to cancel the trip already? I would like to take advantage of the fact that someone has a duty here to quote from the World Health Organisation: the current situation calls for facts, does not ask for fear; asks for science, not hearsay; asks for solidarity, does not ask for stigma. We started by having the stigma of the Chinese, probably at the end of this process we'll thank them for the way they solved the problem at their home.\nI would like to see something happening in Portugal, that the government should have already taken preventive measures, something like that. Let us talk about the effect: macroeconomic, at present, if we talk about travel, I do not think the effect is significant for the sector, it has had an effect on the journeys to China, which have ended, on the trips here from China, which ended. That's the effect until last week.\nAnd what was the biggest effect? The Chinese who didn't come, after all, the Chinese who didn't come. Although the Chinese issuing market is important, growing, it has a lower share than 2.5% on the Portuguese market. And so it had the effect it had, it's a period, we'll see when they come back. And if we talk about the fate of China, it has even less effect. Because it is not a very important destination on the Portuguese market and because this is not a very important time for the Portuguese to holiday. Of course there's trouble.\nIf you ask me'for China there are no reservations', of course there are no reservations at the moment, there are cancellations, there are still some cancellations. Are we expecting reservations for Italy this week? Surely there are no reserves this week for Italy, it seems logical to me. Will there be cancellations? There will be a lot of dialogue, \"can I go?\" and \"should I go?\" and \"should I change my destination?\" \"can I change my height?\" and \"can I wait to see?\" and \"how long can I wait before I have to pay for something without reimbursement?\" and there is all this dialogue, but the whole dialogue certainly does not include new reservations. Te.\nWe have a problem for Easter? It seems reasonable to me to say yes, that the sector will have a problem at Easter. The major reserves are now starting in March, Easter is in April and there is no expectation of a spike in reserves with this whole environment, which has not yet reached its peak.\nThe Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because obviously if there are no reserves and there are no travel there will be less revenue, less billing.\nWhat is Easter worth in the sector? Let us imagine that the crisis worsens until Easter, does that mean what? Easter to leisure is an important point. Let's just say it's not critical yet. If we recover by summer, and we have had other epidemics in which two months later things were clarified, I think that if we have a normal summer, the effects will feel, but they will not be so significant.\nCan you account for it? We can still think of a year that is not entirely negative, but opportunities will be lost in Easter and we will se e summer.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nWe are, as I said, in the area of unpredictability, we do not know what will happen in the coming days, in the coming weeks. If you were my travel agent and I came to this moment and said, \"I am thinking of travelling Spain, France, Italy, I don't know, for Easter, for the summer, I don't know. Is it worth booking the trip? What right do I have if I cancel it?\" We have to follow and follow very closely information from the community portal, that is the basis of whether or not there is a legal possibility of reimbursement, whether the community portal does not advise travel to a particular region or whether it is advisable. The great truth is that the portal today, because of the coronavirus, does not advise China and North Italy and Milan, some parts of the South, for young people. Outside these two regions, today there is no limit to travel. The health ministers of Italy and the countries bordering Italy met and decided that the borders remain open. WHO says there are no restrictions on travel or trade.\nTurning to Tourism as a springboard for growth in recent years, still with the coronavirus: if this crisis reaches the summer, or extends beyond the summer, do you think the engine of our growth will flu? I do not know if it flu, but it will slow down. In the worst-case scenario, the whole world economic model will have difficulties. At the outset, and in front of everyone, tourism, because it is the movement of people and therefore, if tourism is going to have difficulties in the worst-case scenario, in Portugal too, we will have to have a reduction in speed. I'm not saying it's gonna happen. In the worst-case scenario, or in several more negative scenarios, I'm sure it is.\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 11-Coronavirus cases in China's Hubei fall for second day, Apple and markets feel impact.

More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\nTedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n“We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,” he said.\nRussia, however, was taking no chances.

One analogy could be demonetisation\".\nWhile Kerala dealt with the Nipah virus effectively and India handled the quarantines of returnees from Wuhan well, \"the number of cases was small\".\nA Wuhan-sized outbreak involving tens of thousands would likely overwhelm India.\nChina has many more doctors and hospital beds relative to its population than India and is a single-party government administered by technocrats.\n\"Even the Chinese system was creaking at the seams,\" he says.\n\nIndia's high levels of pollution leave large numbers battling coughs.\nCoughs in the audience punctuate Menon's talk, and he himself was suffering from one.\nThis is an additional challenge for overloaded hospitals in India.\n\"Respiratory distress as one possible symptom of the coronavirus infection in a country that contains 18 of the 20 world's most polluted cities, isn't particularly useful,\" he wryly points out.\nAfter questions about how long a vaccine might take and whether Covid-19 came from a biological warfare lab, which Menon dismisses, the talk is wrapped up.\nMenon is surrounded by people who want the professor to play doctor.\nIs it safe to fly?

He added that incident left him speechless and he yelled back at the drive-by verbal assaulter, who had already fled the scene. “This is emotional,” he said. “This affected my psyche.” \n Last week, Ma joined the digital campaign called #WashTheHate, which aims to raise awareness of COVID-19-related anti-Asian sentiment.

And this number remained stable for weeks, with authorities trying to figure out the route of the infected in Italy.\nOnly almost twenty days later, the 22nd day of February, the first case of internal contamination would be confirmed in a city about 60 kilometres from Milan: the small Codogno in northern Italy confirmed six cases of infection with the new coronavirus and decided to shut down all public and private sites, including schools, services and supermarkets.\nThe following day the alarms were sounding again: the Italian authorities confirmed two coronavirus deaths and about six dozen new infections, when 24-hour earlier there were fewer than ten confirmed cases. And since that day, the numbers have been multiplying.\nThe northern regions of Lombardy, Genous and Emilia Romagna are the most affected by the outbreak -85% of the infected are from that region, which is suffering about 90% of deaths. But the virus has already been confirmed in all twenty regions of the country.\nThis Thursday, the death count of the new coronavirus outbreak rose 250 to 1266 obits.

It's the highest daily increase in absolute numbers since the contagion accelerated.\nFor the situation to have evolved s o quickly, the Italian authorities believe that the new coronavirus entered the country long before the first case was detected, a s Time Flavia Riccardo, a researcher for the Infectious Diseases Department of the Italian National Health Institute, says. \"All this happened exactly when we were dealing with our peak influenza A, when citizens showed symptoms of that pathology,\" he says.\nEven before the first cases were confirmed, there were abnormally high numbers of pneumonia patients in a hospital in Codogno and these health facilities may have become sources of infection. As the virus spread for a few weeks undetected, authorities believe this may be one of the reasons why Italian numbers on the covid-19 are so high. \"By the time we realized [the disease], there were already many active transmission chains\", says the researcher to Time.\nIn addition, the specialist advances, Italy may have a larger number of cases recorded as a result of more stringent tests than the other countries: it has already tested more than 40 thousand people. However, this does not explain lethality.\nFor now, the pattern of deaths recorded in Italy is similar to that found in China. They are the elderly with associated diseases such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system that are being most affected. According to the National Institute of Health, the average age of patients with coronavirus that died in Italy is 81 years old.\nBut the figures are high: Germany, with 2369 infected, adds only five dead, while Italy, with a similar number (2502 to March 4) already recorded 80; Spain has 4209 cases and 120 deaths, while Italy with 4636 cases (March 7th) had 197s deaths.\nAs already known, the elderly are one of the groups particularly susceptible to the virus and Italy has the most ageing population in Europe, 23% with 65 or more years. Globally, it is only surpassed by Japan. But can this help explain such a large number of deaths?\nConstantino Sakellarides, former Director-General of Health, jubilated professor at the National School of Public Health\nand current member of the National Public Health Council, explains that the Italian case may be related to the fact that Northern Italy is one of the most \"prosperous\" regions in the world. \"It is no accident that this happened in Milan and not in Lisbon. It has to do with the intense relations China has with the most developed business nuclei in the world, among these Milan,\" said the expert, pointing out that, The fact that Northern Italy is a rich region makes it very well served in terms of health services.\nOn the deaths associated with the virus and recorded so far in the country, particularly among older people, the public health expert prefers to focus on the method of calculation of deaths. \"It is difficult to associate the deaths in Italy only with an ageing population, and we cannot talk about mortality rates, but about lethality rates. The first is the number of deaths in the population and the second are the victims in the infected population. When we say 6% we are talking about 6% of patients rather than 6% of the Italian population. Anna, as this would be a catastrophe\", explains the former Director-General of Health. Constantine Sakellarides argues that the situation in Italy is\"dramatic\", but it is difficult to base it only on the ageing of citizens, because South Korea or Japan are so (or more) aged. According to the latest reports, South Korea has so far registered 7979 confirmed cases and 66 deaths, and Japan has detected 639 cases and 16 deaths.\nThe expert rejects treating Italy as a special case against the other exporting countries of the new coronavirus and considers that the Italian case, the most serious case of the epidemic outside China, relates to \"the loss of containment capacity\".\nIn the light of recent measures taken by the Italian Government in a disproportionate effort to contain the virus, Constantine Sakellarides explains that while other countries have had time to learn and study how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, Italy has not had that luck. \"We, like other countries, have already had more than two months of Chinese experience and other weeks of Italian experience dealing with the virus. Chinese measures have been very muscular, and most countries are not able to implement efforts of this kind,\" explains the public health expert. \"Italy has not had the benefit of learning from other countries other than China and I have the impression that it acted later; hence several countries are now acting earlier, such as Portugal.\"\nAccording to the expert, this virus, due to its transmissibility and its incubation period, is circulating much faster than it appears. \"There is a small increase at the beginning and then an exponential increase, as we have seen in several countries, such as Spain, Denmark and Italy itself. We have made the decision to close many public spaces and schools in the 80 cases, Denmark at 500, and Spain at 2000. It is a dangerous word at this time, we have been able to take advantage of the examples and make a decision of these long before others,\"said the former Health Minister's former adviser.\"And we must not forget that social pressure also has a lot of impact on these political decisions to close schools and other public spaces.\"\nAccording to a study published this Friday in the scientific journal The Lancet by two Italian researchers, the number of infected patients since February 21 in Italy is following an \"exponential trend\". \"If this trend continues for another week, there will be 30 thousand infected patients\", they move forward.\nAccording to this research, which provides up-to-date information on the Italian scenario, the average age of those who died in the country was 81 years and more than two thirds of these patients had diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer. \"While it is true that these patients already had other health problems, it is also important to note that, because of SARS-CoV-2, they needed respiratory support and would not have died otherwise\", the study advances.\nOf the first eight victims, 14,1% were over 90, 42,2% between 80 and 89 years, 32,4% between 70 and 79 years, 8,4% between 60 and 69 years and only 2,8% between 50 and 59 years.\nThere are around 5200 beds in intensive care units in Italy. From these researchers advance, more than a thousand are already being occupied by SARS-CoV-2 infected citizens. \"In the near future, this number\nIt will progressively increase to the point where thousands of beds will be occupied by patients with covid-19. Given that the mortality of severely ill patients is high, the number of infected people in Italy is likely to put a great deal of pressure on intensive care in hospitals, some of which lack the resources or teams to deal with this emergency,\"said investigators. This factor can increase mortality.\nThe two experts believe that the restrictions must continue to be imposed so that what happened in China does not happen in Italy. \"If the Italian outbreak follows a trend similar to that of China, we can hope that the number of newly infected patients will begin to decrease. Similarly, we can predict that the cumulative curve of infected patients will reach its peak thirty days later\", suggests the authors.\nWhile the other countries deal with new cases of SARS-CoV-2 on a daily basis, China reported only eight new cases of infection this Friday, the lowest number since it started the daily count in January. By midnight Thursday (16h00 on Wednesday in Lisbon), mainland China had 3169 deaths and a total infected 80.793. But 62.793 people were released after they had overcome the disease to date, leaving 14.831 in treatment.\nThe roles appear to have reversed: in view of the imported cases, one of the priorities of the Chinese authorities is now to \"protect against the import\" of infections from other countries. Numbers have fallen sharply in comparison to last month, when the number of new cases rose to over a thousand a day. The spokesman for the National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said Thursday that the peak of the epidemic has already passed in China, but that \"the rapid development of the epidemic abroad has brought new uncertainties\".\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nNote: The figures contained in the information in this article were collected by the PUBLIC on the morning of March 13th.

NEW DELHI - India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.  \n The estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.  \n The scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.  \n \"Even with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis,\" said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.  \n The study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.  \n The analysis first appeared on Medium, a U.S. publishing platform, on Saturday.  \n India probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.  \n \"We can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time,\" Chaudhry said. But he warned that there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff to handle a sharp spike in critical patients.  \n India's federal health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research did not respond to questions about the forecasts.  \n  \n PARTIAL LOCKDOWN  \n So far, India has reported 471 cases of the coronavirus and 9 deaths, numbers dwarfed by countries like China, Italy and Spain, but which are nonetheless beginning to accelerate.  \n Authorities have imposed a lockdown across large parts of the country, including in the capital city New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai.  \n The original study was based on data up to March 16, but following a request from Reuters, the team updated their model using cases from Indian health authorities up to March 21.  \n The model was based on one used by colleagues to analyse the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, and employed a set of equations taking into account the number of susceptible people, those infected and those who recovered.  \n That created a predictive model for case counts in India and provided projections under hypothetical public health interventions of varying intensities.  \n According to the estimates, the number of confirmed cases could rise to more than 4,000 by the end of March and to between 30,000 and 230,000 by end-April.  \n Although the researchers have not projected the number of fatalities, Mukherjee said India could be hard hit because of large numbers of people with existing conditions who were potentially more vulnerable to the virus.  \n  \n EARLY CONTAINMENT  \n India has tested around 20,000 individuals, and health authorities have said the virus has remained largely restricted to those who travelled to affected areas and others who came into direct contact with them.  \n India has shut down its massive railways network, banned all incoming international flights and has ordered commercial airlines to stop domestic operations from midnight on Tuesday.  \n But some health officials are concerned that individuals from high-risk areas may not have been caught by multiple safety nets, allowing the virus to spread.  \n Over the weekend, a group of federal lawmakers and bureaucrats in New Delhi were forced to self-quarantine after a Bollywood singer who travelled from London tested positive for the virus in a neighbouring northern state.  \n The singer had earlier been at an event attended by a member of parliament, who subsequently went to several meetings in New Delhi.  \n Mukherjee said India needed quickly to undertake large-scale testing and contact tracing for exposed individuals.  \n \"But if there is expanded community transmission, central lockdown may be the only way,\" she said.

The spike in numbers comes even as Beijing reiterated its confidence in containing the disease.Fears of the spreading virus led airlines to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country. CNBC reported that the White House had told United States (US) airlines it may suspend all China-US flights due to the outbreak.The new figures came as Japan airlifted about 200 of its nationals out of the city, and the US evacuated about 240 Americans by air.More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries.The flu-like virus has spread overseas to more than a dozen countries. None of the confirmed deaths to date has been outside China. However, confirmations of person-to-person transmission in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan – as opposed to a traveller from China – has heightened concern.Known as 2019-nCoV, the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia and, like other respiratory infections, it spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.

SINGAPORE — China’s embassy in Singapore has slammed former diplomat Bilahari Kausikan over a commentary in The Straits Times, saying that it misinterpreted and smeared China’s political and leadership systems, and was no different from the stereotypical “cliche of Western anti-China voices”. \n The embassy said in its 589-word broadside published on its Facebook page on Tuesday (Feb 25): “All constructive comments and suggestions are welcomed, but arrogance and prejudice through coloured glasses are unacceptable. \n “This kind of arrogance and prejudice is manifested as… hostility towards anything related to China.” \n The embassy added: “Aiming to obstruct China’s sound development momentum, they attack China's political system and development model, and try to undermine China's social stability.”   \n Asked for his response to the Chinese embassy’s criticism, Mr Bilahari, who chairs the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, told TODAY: “What else could they say? All Chinese diplomats are under pressure to respond to President Xi’s instruction to assert China’s narrative.” \n He added that the embassy did not address any substantive point that he made. \n “Instead, they raise arguments against points I did not make, which is quite typical. It is not something I can take seriously.” \n In his commentary published on Monday, titled Coronavirus: China’s inflection point and the CCP’s fundamental dilemma, Mr Bilahari, a former permanent secretary at Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described China as a Leninist state led by a vanguard party that insists on absolute control. \n The Covid-19 outbreak — which began in Wuhan, China and has since spread around the world — is a consequence of this Leninist value system. It has also dented the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with the Chinese people, Mr Bilahari said.  \n He wrote that the CCP’s legitimacy rests on economic performance and it has to confront a fundamental dilemma: The essence of a Leninist state is the party’s insistence on control, yet the market — by definition — means less control. \n Mr Bilahari said that it was unclear if China would go beyond fixing the serious flaws in its healthcare system after the coronavirus crisis tails off, and deal with the fundamental challenge of finding a new balance between control and economic efficiency. \n He noted that in the long sweep of Chinese history, the times of maximum danger for ruling dynasties were when periods of internal uncertainty coincided with those of external uncertainty. \n “We may be in such a time,” Mr Bilahari wrote, arguing that the CCP is nearing an “inflection point” and fundamental decisions “cannot continue to be postponed indefinitely”. \n ‘WHETHER THE SHOE FITS OR NOT, ONLY THE WEARER KNOWS’ \n In its Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said that at a time when China is “making enormous efforts and sacrifices” to fight the virus outbreak, Mr Bilahari’s sense of justice to “ideologically denigrate China and sell his long-held prejudice and even hostility towards China has to be questioned”. \n “Whether the shoe fits or not, only the wearer knows. \n “Whether a country's development path is right or not only depends on whether it is in line with the country's reality,” the embassy said. \n The embassy also set out a series of feats that China has achieved in the last seven decades, including rising to become the world’s second-biggest economy and lifting more than 800 million people out of poverty. \n “Such achievements, unique in human history, have been made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and under the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. \n “It has not only benefited the Chinese people, but also brought abundant opportunities to the prosperity and development for the rest of the world,” the embassy stated. \n It added that China’s political system and development path have effectively solved the principal social contradictions and problems across different periods of China’s growth. \n “Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them,” the embassy said. \n “Actually, it is logically self-contradictory.” \n The embassy said that China’s firm commitment to upholding the CCP and its central committee, with Chinese Presiden\nt Xi Jinping at its core, would not waver. \n It reiterated: “Facts have proved and will continue to prove that nothing can derogate the advantages of the socialism with Chinese characteristics.” \n The embassy also stressed that Mr Xi, who is the general secretary of the CCP, is in “full command” and the country is united in fighting the coronavirus epidemic, which it called “the enemy to all mankind”. \n The embassy added: “Mr Bilahari put the blame of the outbreak on China's political system. Then regarding… the H1N1 flu that originated in North America and spread worldwide, which one should be blamed? \n “At the moment, what the world needs most is unity and trust, not the political virus that keeps people at bay.”\n"}, {"content": "Chinese virus pushes bags towards red.

BEIJING (XINHUA) - China and Italy reaffirmed bilateral ties in a phone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, with Beijing offering to provide Rome with medical aid to help fight the coronavirus. Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy's latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China's successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy's support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy's urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China's eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.  \n Zhejiang’s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province.

If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, the Wuhan strain that is now spreading may eventually be traced back to bats. \n Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years, studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said: \"We don't know the source yet, but there's pretty strong evidence that this is a bat-origin coronavirus.\" \n \"It's probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,\" he added, referring to a common species that weighs up to 28g. \n If he is right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. \n They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. \n They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. \n They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species. \n But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory. \n Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats' evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems. \n In a 2018 paper in Cell Host And Microbe, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. \n The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they should not be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. \n But in bats, the scientists found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses. \n Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response, but it is still there. \n Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a \"balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses\". \n How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as nCoV-2019 is, of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. \n \"The outbreak can be contained and controlled,\" Dr Daszak said. \"But if we don't know the origin in the long term, then this virus can continue to spill over.\" \n Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen. \n In the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that \"it is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.\" \n They added: \"In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.\" \n This was not clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom. \n Certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. \n But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 per cent, and then there is the rest of us. \n Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease. \n People in many parts of the world e\nat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of Sars and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. \n Bats also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another. \n In a 2017 report in Nature, Dr Daszak, Dr Kevin J. Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts. \n They confirmed what scientists had thought: \"Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.\" Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans. \n And they do not just survive the viruses they harbour. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. \n Others live closer to 40. One tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years. Animals like house mice live about two years on average. \n While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. \n As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa. \n Dr Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, he says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. \n He compared the situation to terrorism. Both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable. To get a jump on them, he said, intelligence is vital. \n NYTIMES\n"}, {"content": "South Korean PM says ‘turning point’ near in coronavirus fight. SEOUL (REUTERS, AFP) - South Korean officials warned against prematurely calling the peak of the coronavirus outbreak while expressing hope on Monday (March 9) that the country was nearing a“turning point” in the crisis, as the pace of new infections trended lower. \n The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 69 new coronavirus cases on Monday, although a more complete figure would be provided in another update later on Monday. \n The new cases brought South Korea’s total infections to 7,382, while the death toll rose by one to 51, the KCDC said. \n The rate of increase in new infections fell to its lowest in 10 days on Sunday in one of the countries most severely affected outside mainland China. \n “I’m still extremely cautious, but there’s hope we can reach a turning point in the near future,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Monday before returning to Seoul from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu. \n Health authorities say the number of new infections being identified has dwindled as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the centre of the epidemic in Daegu have now been tested. \n Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said it was premature to say the crisis was over, as new cases continued to emerge from smaller clusters. \n “There are still many patients arising from Daegu and nearby regions ... and sporadic infections continue to emerge elsewhere, though they’re not spreading as fast,” Kim told a briefing. \n “In fact, now is the time to concentrate all our capabilities to bring a clear reduction in infections.” \n South Korea started rationing surgical masks on Monday after imposing an export ban amid panic buying. \n Mutual travel restrictions imposed by South Korea and Japan also took effect, an issue that rekindled a diplomatic and economic feud between the old foes. \n South Korea suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan on Friday, after Tokyo announced travel restrictions, joining more than 100 other countries limiting arrivals from South Korea. \n The spat, together with oil price swings, sent South Korean shares and the won sharply lower and prompted the finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against disorderly market movement. \n South Korea was the first country to report significant coronavirus numbers outside China, where the disease first emerged. \n But in recent days the focus of global concern has been moving towards Italy and Iran, a quarter of Italy’s population in lockdown Sunday as Rome announced infections soaring past 7,000 and deaths spiking to 366. \n"}, {"content": "Luis Figo hopes coronavirus outbreak won't affect Euro2020 football.

The new coronavirus has caused more than 900 deaths and has infected over 40.500 people. The numbers should not stop here and may even be aggravated by the end of the prolonged Chinese Lunar New Year's holiday. To find out which countries the virus can be imported more easily, German scientists used a computational model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing the coronavirus is \"very low\", with the country in the 61st position on the relative risk list for importing the virus. The Health Directorate (DGS) also announced this Monday two more suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus were six so far, and one of them was already negative at the beginning of the night. The second suspicious case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Centre of San Juan in Porto, it also had a negative result, informed the DGS already this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight.\nCases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than twenty countries. Even if the vast majority of cases are limited to China, there is still concern that they may spread further around the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, considering the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the 4000 airport air transport network and more than 50.000 air routes. Airport closures due to the epidemic have already been included in the model.\nIt was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analysed with coronavirus. This list follows Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia. The first European country on this list is Germany, which is in 18th place. Although Angola is on the list of 13 African countries with top priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, it does not include the top-10 of African countries with the highest risk of importation in this model. This top is headed by Ethiopia, followed by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria and Tunisia. Overall, according to the model, Angola is in 115th place.\n\"Portugal has a very low risk of import,\" says Public Dirk Brockmann of Humboldt University. \"It is in 61.th position with a relative import risk of 0,01%, which is about 20 times smaller than the risk of Germany.\" Nevertheless, while Germany has a risk of 0,2%, Thailand has 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann points out that the purpose of this model is to give an overview of the current situation and be a risk analysis tool that can be used by policy makers and public health authorities. In addition to providing country-specific alerts, the model provides data for specific airports.\nAlthough we've given so much to talk about, we still don't know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus.\nSamples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutions. From there, a team from the University of California in Santa Cruz (USA) collected information from 29.903 nucleotides, adenine, timine, cytosine and guanine, the basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T, C and G, and made it available in the public database Genome Browser.\n\"By providing data on coronavirus in the Browser Genome at the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows investigators to observe the structure of the virus and, more importantly, investigate how they can attack it,\" stated Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university.\nThe way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. CoronVirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, DGS states. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two teachers from the University Hospital d\nand Greifswald in Germany tried to answer these questions.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on coronavirus SARS and MERS. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature on average between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and high humidity in the air further increase your life span\", says Gunter Kampf in a statement from his institution.\nAs for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, commonly oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were found to be effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles from one million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronavirus and the results were similar\", says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, public health agency professionals, health ministers and research backers will be meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnoses and coronavirus vaccines. In this meeting organized by the WHO in conjunction with the Global Research Collaboration for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, we will discuss the origin of the virus, identify knowledge gaps or medical products that should be necessary to minimise the impact of the epidemic. \"The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus,\" says the WHO in communication.\nAn international mission led by the WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how the transmission between people takes place, how the virus spreads in hospitals or why some people are dying.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThis Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to various sites in Beijing, notably a community centre, a hospital or disease control centre. Xi Jinping was always seen with a mask and his temperature was measured. At Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus-infected patients are being treated, Xi Jinping even took part in a video conference with health professionals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited.\nThis is considered a rare public appearance of Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and ended up being punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day that many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already pointed out that the number of cases outside China can only be \"the tip of an iceberg\".\n"}, {"content": "Count Vila sets up a working group to respond to coronavirus cases.

A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, travelled 400 miles(675 km) north to Anyang where she infected five relatives, without ever showing signs of infection, Chinese scientists reported on Friday, offering new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n The case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested why it may be difficult to stop.  \n \"Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill?

BANGKOK - Thailand's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low of 0.75% on Friday as the spread of the coronavirus exerted further pressure on the flagging economy.  \n The Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee (MPC), in a special meeting, voted unanimously to lower the one-day repurchase rate <THCBIR=ECI> in a back-to-back cut this year.  \n The rate cut was the fourth since August. Friday's special meeting was the first time since 2003.  \n \"This will mitigate the impact on the economy and also reinforce fiscal measures already implemented and forthcoming,\" the BOT said in a statement.  \n That will also reduce the burden of interest on borrowers affected by the coronavirus outbreak and alleviate strains on liquidity in the financial markets, it said.  \n \"The committee viewed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the period ahead would be more severe than previously expected and the situation would take some time before returning to normal. This would severely affect the Thai economy,\" it added.  \n The pandemic has roiled global financial markets, affecting liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite the overall stability of the financial system, it said.  \n The rate cut suggests the MPC is accepting that the Thai economy is entering a recession along with the global economy, said Amonthep Chawla, an economist at CIMB Thai.  \n (GRAPHIC: Thai GDP and regional peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2187/2155/Thai%20GDP%20VS%20regional%20peers.png)  \n Central banks around the world have slashed interest rates in the past few weeks and provided additional stimulus in some cases to try to help alleviate the threat to the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n Thailand on Friday reported 50 new coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 322. One person has died.  \n \"We now see two further policy rate cuts of 25 bps each in Q2 and Q3, taking the rate to a record-low 0.25% at end-2020,\" said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered.  \n \"Policy space is running out, and alternatives have not been communicated,\" he said.  \n The MPC will still meet to review policy on March 25, as scheduled, when it will also offer updated economic forecasts.  \n It is expected to slash its 2020 growth forecast from 2.8%. Some economists predict negative growth for Thailand this year.  \n Thailand is considered one of the economies most vulnerable to the virus in Southeast Asia due to its heavy reliance on Chinese tourists and China trade. Foreign receipts accounted for about 11% of Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) last year.  \n Tourist numbers may fall by 25% this year as a result of the pandemic, the Tourism Authority of Thailand said.  \n Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded just 2.4% last year, the lowest in five years.  \n For the full text, click on https://www.bot.or.th/English/PressandSpeeches/Press/2020/Pages/n1463.aspx REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "drugmakers see long road ahead in coronavirus vaccine race. Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go.  \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality.  \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion.  \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's <GSK.L> vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.  \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.  \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.  \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.  \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.  \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola.  \n  \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET'  \n Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.  \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.  \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said.  \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.  \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.  \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\"  \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.  \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc <MRNA.O>, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.  \n Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.  \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.  \n Novavax Inc <NVAX.O> research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and b\nelieves it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.  \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.  \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said.  \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.  \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.  \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc <INO.O>, Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.  \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's <JNJ.N> chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" REUTERS\n"}, {"content": "The League and the Gamblers Guild set up a committee to monitor the coronavirus pandemic.
